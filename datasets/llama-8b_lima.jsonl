{"instruction":"In our computer systems lecture we were introduced to the MIPS processor. It was (re)developed over the course of the term and has in fact been quite easy to understand. It uses a RISC design, that is its elementary commands are regularly encoded and there are only few of them in order to keep the wires simple.\nIt was mentioned that CISC follows a different philosophy. I looked briefly at the x86 instruction set and was shocked. I can not image how anyone would want to build a processor that uses so complex a command set!\nSo I figure there have to be good arguments why large portions of the processor market use CISC architectures. What are they? ","response":"There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the \u201coriginal\u201d 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Slater type orbitals (STO) are considered to be more accurate than gaussian type orbitals (GTO) for atomic and molecular QM calculations because - among other reasons - they decay with $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. But GTOs are more popular because they are easier to calculate with. GTOs decay with $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, so its adequate to sometimes add diffuse functions to the GTO basis set to compensate for gaussian decay behaviour.\nAlso, exact hydrogen wavefunctions decay exponentially, so the motivation for STOs.\nI understand that the only boundary requirement for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for atoms and molecules in free space is that the wavefunction goes zero as $r \\to \\infty$, but there are no a priori requirements for the way it decays as it does so.\nMy question is: do we have theoretical (ab initio) and\/or experimental reasons to believe that all atomic and molecular wavefunctions decay like $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$.","response":"I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n$$\n(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}))\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\mathbf{r})\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nfor some unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schr\u00f6dinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

{"instruction":"Tor can only handle TCP connections, but DNS is a UDP protocol. How does Tor route DNS requests over its TCP based network? Why can the same approach not be used to route all UDP traffic over Tor?","response":"Tor clients do not, in general, directly do DNS requests.  When you open a connection through the tor network you usually ask your client (on its socks ports) to connect you to a hostname and port, say www.example.com:80.\nYour tor client, once it has created a circuit, will send that hostname and port to the exit node in its RELAY_BEGIN cell.\nThe exit node will then do a DNS resolve and open a TCP connection to the target.  Once that's established it will tell your client that the connection is open, and for informational purposes will also tell your client what address that hostname resolved to.\nTor, in addition to that, has some sort of \"remote DNS resolve\" protocol built in.  This support allows clients to query for certain resource types, like IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Here too, the exit node does the actual DNS packet sending and receiving and just relays the answer to the client.\nNo UDP packets are actually ever routed from the client.\nThere's also a proposal to add more full featured DNS support to Tor.  So far it hasn't been implemented.\n\nTor Protocol Specification references\n\n* 6.2. Opening streams and transferring data\n* 6.4.

But that isn't the question. The question is why? Are there any references in JLS which confirms this behaviour, especially of the 2nd case?","response":"The difference is that the explicit type of the ```returnsNull()``` method affects the static typing of the expressions at compile time:\n```E1: `true ? returnsNull() : false` - boolean (auto-unboxing 2nd operand to boolean)\nE2: `true ? null : false` - Boolean (autoboxing of 3rd operand to Boolean)\n```\nSee Java Language Specification, section 15.25 Conditional Operator ? :\n\n* For E1, the types of the 2nd and 3rd operands are ```Boolean``` and ```boolean``` respectively, so this clause applies:\n\n  If one of the second and third operands is of type boolean and the type of the other is of type Boolean, then the type of the conditional expression is boolean.\n\nSince the type of the expression is ```boolean```, the 2nd operand must be coerced to ```boolean```.  The compiler inserts auto-unboxing code to the 2nd operand (return value of ```returnsNull()```) to make it type ```boolean```.  This of course causes the NPE from the ```null``` returned at run-time.\n* For E2, types of the 2nd and 3rd operands are `````` (not ```Boolean``` as in E1!) and ```boolean``` respectively, so no specific typing clause applies (go read 'em!), so the final \"otherwise\" clause applies:\n\n  Otherwise, the second and third operands are of types S1 and S2 respectively. Let T1 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S1, and let T2 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S2. The type of the conditional expression is the result of applying capture conversion (\u00a75.1.10) to lub(T1, T2) (\u00a715.12.2.7).\n\n\n* S1 == `````` (see \u00a74.1)\n* S2 == ```boolean```\n* T1 == box(S1) == `````` (see last item in list of boxing conversions in  \u00a75.1.7)\n* T2 == box(S2) == `Boolean\n* lub(T1, T2) == ```Boolean```\n\nSo the type of the conditional expression is ```Boolean``` and the 3rd operand must be coerced to ```Boolean```.

{"instruction":"I need to be able to open a document using its default application in Windows and Mac OS. Basically, I want to do the same thing that happens when you double-click on the document icon in Explorer or Finder. What is the best way to do this in Python?","response":"```open``` and ```start``` are command-interpreter things for Mac OS\/X and Windows respectively, to do this.\nTo call them from Python, you can either use ```subprocess``` module or ```os.system()```. \nHere are considerations on which package to use:\n\n* You can call them via ```os.system```, which works, but...\nEscaping: ```os.system``` only works with filenames that don't have any spaces or other shell metacharacters in the pathname (e.g. ```A:\\abc\\def\\a.txt```), or else these need to be escaped. There is ```shlex.quote``` for Unix-like systems, but nothing really standard for Windows. Maybe see also python, windows : parsing command lines with shlex\n\n* MacOS\/X: ```os.system(\"open \" + shlex.quote(filename))```\n* Windows: ```os.system(\"start \" + filename)``` where properly speaking ```filename``` should be escaped, too.\n\n* You can also call them via ```subprocess``` module, but...\nFor Python 2.7 and newer, simply use\n```subprocess.check_call(['open', filename])\n```\nIn Python 3.5+ you can equivalently use the slightly more complex but also somewhat more versatile\n```subprocess.run(['open', filename], check=True)\n```\nIf you need to be compatible all the way back to Python 2.4, you can use ```subprocess.call()``` and implement your own error checking:\n```try:\n    retcode = subprocess.call(\"open \" + filename, shell=True)\n    if retcode < 0:\n        print >>sys.stderr, \"Child was terminated by signal\", -retcode\n    else:\n        print >>sys.stderr, \"Child returned\", retcode\nexcept OSError, e:\n    print >>sys.stderr, \"Execution failed:\", e\n```\nNow, what are the advantages of using ```subprocess```?\n\n* Security: In theory, this is more secure, but in fact we're needing to execute a command line one way or the other; in either environment, we need the environment and services to interpret, get paths, and so forth.  In neither case are we executing arbitrary text, so it doesn't have an inherent \"but you can type ```'filename ; rm -rf \/'```\" problem, and if the file name can be corrupted, using ```subprocess.call``` gives us little additional protection.\n* Error handling: It doesn't actually give us any more error detection, we're still depending on the ```retcode``` in either case; but the behavior to explicitly raise an exception in the case of an error will certainly help you notice if there is a failure (though in some scenarios, a traceback might not at all be more helpful than simply ignoring the error).\n* Spawns a (non-blocking) subprocess: We don't need to wait for the child process, since we're by problem statement starting a separate process.\n\nTo the objection \"But ```subprocess``` is preferred.\"  However, ```os.system()``` is not deprecated, and it's in some sense the simplest tool for this particular job. Conclusion: using ```os.system()``` is therefore also a correct answer.\nA marked disadvantage is that the Windows ```start``` command requires you to pass in ```shell=True``` which negates most of the benefits of using ```subprocess```.\n","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why does PRC devalue its currency on purpose, but Turkey is worried about the devaluation of its currency?","response":"Trade surplus\/deficit\nDevaluing one's currency means mostly one thing: It becomes more expensive to import products from abroad, while one's own products become comparably cheaper to buy on the world market. That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here. Turkey is actively inviting foreign investors, but China is quite reluctant to allow foreign economic influence in their country.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Is it worth patenting an algorithm if I don't have the money to defend against infringements?","response":"This is a great question, with no one right answer.\nThe strength of a patent comes from the ability to enforce it. If the patent owner cannot enforce it for whatever reason (such as a lack of funding), the patent is effectively toothless.\nBut your competitors will likely not know that. They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could. You might therefore get quite some value from selling it off at some point. There are a number of tech businesses where most of their value comes from their IP portfolio.\nOn the whole therefore it depends how you see yourself proceeding. If you're unsure, it may pay to err on the side of patenting: once you disclose or use your invention publicly, you're generally barred from patenting it later (but for a short grace period in some countries), whereas it's easy to abandon a patent (or application) later down the track if you wish.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

This casting operation is normally automatic, since it's always safe and can be implemented directly by the compiler. Downcast operations (also called narrowing conversions in the Java Language Specification) convert an ancestor class reference to a subclass reference. This casting operation creates execution overhead, since Java requires that the cast be checked at runtime to make sure that it's valid.

{"instruction":"Why is FIFA against adding instant replay to the game?","response":"There are a few fundamental considerations:\n\n* Uncertainty is a part of the game. The referee and linesmen are the arbiters of the action. Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\"\n\nBlatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in S\u00e3o Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today.\nAlthough it's not quite \"instant replay,\" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: \"Hawk-Eye\" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and \"GoalRef\" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed \"goal\" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup. The Guardian provides a pretty helpful FAQ on the technology.\nFIFA may choose to implement further changes to approved goal-line technology and referee rules when it meets again after the World Cup.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The referee is an arbiter of the action.","max_prob":13.8213157654,"ccp":-0.4037467055},{"claim":"The linesmen are arbiters of the action.","max_prob":14.2835102081,"ccp":-0.2405907673},{"claim":"Many places do not have access to technology.","max_prob":9.6442575455,"ccp":-0.7955296113},{"claim":"Technology is necessary to implement instant replay.","max_prob":7.5272068977,"ccp":-0.3429579289},{"claim":"Football is a fast-paced game.","max_prob":6.330488205,"ccp":-0.2454527312},{"claim":"Football has few opportunities for stoppage.","max_prob":14.5401992798,"ccp":-0.0036951304},{"claim":"In 2008, Sepp Blatter was the President of FIFA.","max_prob":19.7497406006,"ccp":-0.000241294},{"claim":"In 2008, Sepp Blatter made a statement.","max_prob":7.9273200035,"ccp":-0.0042392943},{"claim":"Television companies will have the right to say the referee was right.","max_prob":27.9934940338,"ccp":-0.0000751986},{"claim":"Television companies will have the right to say the referee was wrong.","max_prob":25.392375946,"ccp":-0.0011950705},{"claim":"The referee makes the decision.","max_prob":6.5661206245,"ccp":-0.977667415},{"claim":"The referee is a man.","max_prob":9.7235050201,"ccp":-0.8590744623},{"claim":"The referee is not a machine.","max_prob":10.6524486542,"ccp":-0.7849829935},{"claim":"Blatter has argued against using instant replay.","max_prob":13.1787500381,"ccp":-0.026127936},{"claim":"Others at FIFA have argued against using instant replay.","max_prob":16.4785003662,"ccp":-0.1553408173},{"claim":"Blatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay.","max_prob":27.9273548126,"ccp":-0.02871927},{"claim":"FIFA held a Congress in S\u00e3o Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup.","max_prob":22.6183547974,"ccp":-0.0073345086},{"claim":"The proposal was similar to how the NFL handles challenges today.","max_prob":31.4327793121,"ccp":-0.0876778876},{"claim":"In 2012, FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies.","max_prob":19.9502906799,"ccp":-0.0722177295},{"claim":"The purpose of these technologies is to improve referee accuracy.","max_prob":12.4413146973,"ccp":-0.7953070317},{"claim":"One of the approved technologies is called \"Hawk-Eye.\"","max_prob":9.4510183334,"ccp":-0.1262576314},{"claim":"\"Hawk-Eye\" uses visual triangulation to determine ball location.","max_prob":22.3844966888,"ccp":-0.5710943047},{"claim":"Another approved technology is called \"GoalRef.\"","max_prob":8.8388643265,"ccp":-0.270963502},{"claim":"\"GoalRef\" uses a microchip in the ball.","max_prob":10.842757225,"ccp":-0.0735764005},{"claim":"\"GoalRef\" uses magnetic sensors within goalposts.","max_prob":13.347943306,"ccp":-0.5270007652},{"claim":"Many people say that FIFA approved certain technologies.","max_prob":22.0500659943,"ccp":-0.0096365036},{"claim":"The technologies were approved in response to an incident involving Frank Lampard.","max_prob":16.3371009827,"ccp":-0.0066678149},{"claim":"Frank Lampard's \"goal\" was snubbed against Germany.","max_prob":13.4268121719,"ccp":-0.0174073288},{"claim":"The incident occurred during the 2010 World Cup.","max_prob":14.146566391,"ccp":-0.0173288062},{"claim":"In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl.","max_prob":10.8626756668,"ccp":-0.0549412804},{"claim":"GoalControl is a German competitor to Hawk-Eye.","max_prob":13.55884552,"ccp":-0.1039757985},{"claim":"FIFA used GoalControl at the Confederations Cup.","max_prob":10.5099134445,"ccp":-0.1097272002},{"claim":"The Confederations Cup is basically a rehearsal for the World Cup.","max_prob":21.3411045074,"ccp":-0.0819794431},{"claim":"There was a successful run at a tournament.","max_prob":7.1147031784,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl.","max_prob":7.3313064575,"ccp":-0.3967205757},{"claim":"The implementation of GoalControl was planned for the 2014 World Cup.","max_prob":4.4224390984,"ccp":-0.9256840641},{"claim":"The Guardian provides an FAQ.","max_prob":16.5299453735,"ccp":-0.007245684},{"claim":"The FAQ is on the technology.","max_prob":5.7439694405,"ccp":-0.5146326475},{"claim":"The FAQ is pretty helpful.","max_prob":20.9491577148,"ccp":-0.2933477833}]}
{"instruction":"If we should encrypt the message rather than the method of transfer, why do we care about wifi security? Is this just security theatre?","response":"Network encryption protects against different set of threats than application layer encryption like TLS.\nIn particular, network encryption like Wifi encryption are primarily designed to protect from a local attacker from being able to watch network patterns (by recording who you're making connections with, and discovering what devices are on the local network), observing\/tampering of low level messages like ARP\/DNS, and protecting network broadcasts from devices that aren't supposed to be in the network, and from tampering or selective interference.\nTLS doesn't protect the low level TCP\/IP packets, which leaks information like the IP address of the machine you're connecting with, and the TLS handshake also by design leaks a number of information about the connection like Server Name Indication (SNI) header.\nThe side effect of needing to do all this is that Wifi hardware already need to have enough code and processing power to handle encryption, so it becomes easier to just encrypt all wifi packets rather than selectively figuring out what needs protection or not. This come also with the side benefit that unsecured HTTP connection will still be at least marginally protected, even if at least to protect users of the infrastructure from each other, but not from the infrastructure provider.\nNetwork encryption is designed to protect the network, not the service. Application encryption is designed to protect the connection to the service, but it doesn't protect the network.

{"instruction":"Applying filter in scipy.signal: Use lfilter or filtfilt?","response":"\n* ```filtfilt``` is zero-phase filtering, which doesn't shift the signal as it filters.

{"instruction":"Were there any flying dinosaurs?","response":"Birds are both flying dinosaurs and flying reptiles. Yes, that's potentially confusing.\n\nTo understand the apparent contradiction, you have to understand how modern classification of organisms works (phylogenetic systematics). Under the old (Linnean) classification system, Reptilia (reptiles) was an order and Aves (birds) was a separate order. Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades). It's like a set of venn diagrams, where all organisms fall into a giant circle and then successively smaller circles classify more and more specific groups.\n\nThe clade Reptilia includes snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and lots of extinct groups, including dinosaurs. So all dinosaurs are reptiles. The clade Dinosauria includes all the extinct dinosaurs (Stegosaurus, Triceratops, sauropods, etc.), including theropod dinosaurs, which include well known dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus. Based on a mountain on anatomical evidence, including lots of transitional fossils, living birds are a sub-group of theropod dinosaurs.\n\nSo all birds (Aves) are theropod dinosaurs (Dinosauria: Theropoda). All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation.","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"Say, a table ```car``` has one-to-one relationship to tables ```electric_car```, ```gas_car```, and ```hybrid_car```. If a ```car``` is ```electric_car```, it can no longer appear in ```gas_car``` or a ```hybrid_car```, etc. \nIs it a bad practice to have several mutually exclusive one-to-one relationships in database design?","response":"The different types of cars are an instance of a general problem that surfaces over and over again in data modeling.  It is called \"generalization\/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass\/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.  Don't be afraid.  But do test your initial design for performance. If your first attempt is simple and sound, you'll be able to tweak it to speed it up.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Julia has much more limited algorithm support but does exhibit a good turn of speed.\nThe few algorithms that Mathematica does support are not particularly well exposed for the type of tweaking needed to win Kaggle competitions.\nMathematica, as of version 10, supports the following classifiers:  \"LogisticRegression\", \"Markov\", \"NaiveBayes\", \"NearestNeighbors\", \"NeuralNetwork\", \"RandomForest\", \"SupportVectorMachine\".  \nWhilst it does offer one ensemble method, RandomForest, it lacks both Bagging and any flavour of boosting, such as Adaboost.

This limits significantly the potential for creating novel methods within the existing machine learning framework. \nMathematica's strengths lay with it's expressive, compact, language, strong visualisation capabilities and easy parallelization.

Vance. The first half of the linked document contains the Court's majority opinion and the concurring opinion of Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, followed by the separate dissenting opinions of Justices Thomas and Alito.\nBased on a quick read, it's apparent that Justice Thomas agrees with the general court's opinion that a sitting President &quot;is not entitled to absolute immunity from issuance of [a] subpoena&quot;. Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency \u2014 e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason \u2014 as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena.

{"instruction":"Just curious, given how heavily from Tolkien D&D drew, and the fact that games like Wizardry used Hobbits, is there a good design reason why Gygax and company used Halflings (a term that also appears in Tolkien) vice Hobbits as the term for our little friends?","response":"Halflings were originally called hobbits prior to a legal challenge.\nAccording to Gary Gygax himself, it was due to a legal claim on &quot;hobbit&quot; by a company who purchased the merchandising rights on Tolkien's works in 1976:\n\nTSR was served with papers threatening damages to the tune of half a mil by the Saul Zantes (sp?) division of Elan Merchandising on behalf of the tolkien Estate. The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976. Zaents would go on to produce the 1978 Lord of the Rings animated movie.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"This guy claims that Olympic powerlifters working in the 1-6 rep range can increase strength without increasing muscle size. \n\n> Trained Olympic lifters, for example, were shown over a two-year period to have significant strength increases with barely noticeable increases in muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size. Obviously, traditional strength training with low volume and low sets (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the best approach. Strength training does cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al, 1985), but it won't cause maximum hypertrophy.\n\nWhat is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true? That is, can a buff guy (with lots of prominent muscle) actually be weak? ","response":"Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he\/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic\/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What are the major concerns about planting trees to create carbon offsets?","response":"Here are some common concerns about using tree planting projects to create carbon offsets:\n\n* The scheme actually has a net positive effect, both in the short and long-term\/\nHow effective a tree planting scheme is in capturing and storing carbon dioxide, is for a large part determined by what happens to the trees after they are planted. When trees mature and are harvested for wood that's used in construction, then the captured carbon dioxide is stored for a long time (until the wood decomposes or is burned). However, if no trees are replanted after harvesting this will have had a one-time effect only. Also when wood is burned (for energy or in a wild fire), or if trees die quickly and decompose, then their captured carbon is released again. Of course all trees die eventually even when they are not harvested, this is part of the natural cycle, but a mature forest can store a lot more carbon than a young, newly-planted forest so it's important to keep a forest intact as much as possible.\n\n* The wrong type(s) of trees are planted in the wrong location.\nIn the past there were bad offsetting schemes that planted non-native trees, or planted trees in a location where they would change water flows  and thus change local ecosystems in a negative way. Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I am wondering how to generate uniformly distributed points on the surface of the 3-d unit sphere? Also after generating those points, what is the best way to visualize and check whether they are truly uniform on the surface $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$?","response":"A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1\/\\lambda, X_2\/\\lambda, X_3\/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3\/(4 \\pi \/ 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.  By computing all interpoint distances you can compare the data to this ideal.\nGeneral principles of constructing statistical graphics suggest a good way to make the comparison is to plot variance-stabilized residuals $e_i(d_{[i]} - e_i)$ against $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n(n-1)\/2=m$ where $d_{[i]}$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ smallest of the mutual distances and $e_i = 2\\sqrt{i\/m}$.

Is it required the other way round, that if a class contains all the static methods, shall the class be static too? What are static classes good for?","response":"Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        \/\/ MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); \/\/ results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n\/\/ A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { \/\/ private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and\/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```. If Java allowed top-level classes to be declared ```static``` then the Math class would indeed be static.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

In all the novels and comics that came out after \"Return of the Jedi\", the Emperor's name was stated plainly: Palpatine. \nSo when I saw the prologue movies, for the life of me I couldn't figure out: was I supposed to know that Palpatine was the villain?  \nMaybe the filmmakers figured that most of the moviegoing public never got into the Expanded Universe.

It was, in fact, one of the very first things people could find out about the Star Wars universe.\nThe point of the films wasn't to conceal the fact Palpatine would end up the Emperor (or was Darth Sidious), it was to show that he was a masterful chessmaster who conned everyone, and that in large part it was the good guys responsible for his rise because of their own blindness. Amidala initiated the vote that removed his predecessor. Jar-Jar initiated the vote that gave him emergency powers. The Jedi Council allowed him to operate under their noses.

He argued with the Hat to sort him into Hufflepuff (src: Pottermore), because he felt he wasn't brave enough to be a Gryffindor.\n\nFifth year\n\n* He joins DA\n\n* He shows marked and significant improvement in his magical abilities while in DA\n\n* He voluntarily joins the DA members who accompany Harry to Ministry of Magic battle in the end of OoP, even arguing with Harry about it:\n\nNeville: &quot;We were all in the D.A. together.

When avoiding the Death Eaters at one point, Neville stumbled into the Room of Requirement, which he was able to turn into a hiding place for the D.A., and to connect to the Hog's Head in order to get food from Aberforth Dumbledore. By May, most of the D.A. had taken to living there.\n\n* During the first round of battle, Neville used various plants to attack Death Eaters, and helped transport the injured and dead when a temporary cease-fire was called.\n\n* When the Death Eaters approached with a &quot;dead&quot; Harry, Neville stood up in defiance of Voldemort. He was subsequently forced to wear the Sorting Hat as it burned because he refused to join Voldemort. Fortunately, due to Harry's sacrifice, Neville was able to shrug off the Full Body-Bind Curse.\n\n* Because of his tremendous bravery shown on the battlefield, Neville was able to pull Godric Gryffindor's Sword from the burning hat, in the process proving himself a true Gryffindor, something that was doubted constantly throughout due to his apparently weak-willed, shy, and bumbling nature. In a single stroke, he killed Nagini, destroying Voldemort's last remaining Horcrux.\n\n* Neville subsequently teamed up with Ron Weasley as the defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters were forced into the Great Hall and defeated Fenrir Greyback.\n\nAll in all, pretty convincing evidence of someone's bravery.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"This claim was made popular by being said in the movie The Social Network. It exactly says:\n\n> Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?\n","response":"This claim can actually be tested very easily. Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1\/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1\/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1\/31,560 (SD=15) or 1\/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1\/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000\/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1\/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000\/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1\/161 would drop to about 1\/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1\/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```.

{"instruction":"Different coffee packets advertise different amounts of 'Robusta' and 'Arabica'? What do these terms refer to, and how does it affect the taste of the coffee?","response":"\n\n* One reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.\n* Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.\n* From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.\n* Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.\n\nAll of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.\nWhere you\u2019ll find it: Nowadays, it\u2019s not often you\u2019ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you\u2019re drinking instant coffee? Well, that\u2019s probably all Robusta\u2026 but you probably don\u2019t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That\u2019s a mixed bag.

Aren't their power directly supplied by the battery of our camera?\nPlease answer for the built in flash on the 2000D and the traditional hot shoe Xenon flashes.\nPerhaps these hot shoe xenon flashes have their own batteries charged by the slow hot shoe port. Who knows? ","response":"The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1\/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal).","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What are some strategies to maintain morale and productivity after massive layoffs? I am not in a managerial role, just a lead role, and am asking for myself and my fellow employees.","response":"The situation you're describing is tough. Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Planning,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Could you please clearly explain what is the difference between correlation and convolution that is done by a filter on an image? \nI mean in terms of signal processing definition I know that convolution describes the output of an LTI system, that is if an LTI system produces an output due to convolution with an input system then the output signal can be described as the result of convolution of the input signal and the impulse response of the LTI system. As for the correlation, it describes the similarities between to signals. But how does convolution and correlation effect on a image and how different are they in terms of effects?\nThanks","response":"Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How can horns, most of which have only three buttons, play all their notes?","response":"Put as simply as possible, horns are tubes. Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F\u266f, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E\u266d, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C\u266f, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves.

{"instruction":"Layman's explanation of encryption backdoors","response":"There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\n\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor.

The reasons it is still important for ```\/bin\/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest\/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest\/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```\/bin\/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```\/bin\/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```\/usr\/bin\/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```\/bin\/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```\/bin\/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```\/bin\/echo``` as well--assuming ```\/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is \/bin\/echo\n```","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"what's the difference between JavaScript objects, classes and functions?","response":"As you must already be aware by now there are no classes in JavaScript. Instead functions in JavaScript may be made to behave like constructors by preceding a function call with the ```new``` keyword. This is known as the constructor pattern.\nIn JavaScript everything is an object except for the primitive data types (boolean, number and string), and ```undefined```. On the other hand ```null``` is actually an object reference even though you may at first believe otherwise. This is the reason ```typeof null``` returns ```&quot;object&quot;```.\nFunctions in JavaScript are similar to functables in Lua (i.e. they are callable objects). Hence a function can be used in place of an object. Similarly arrays are also objects in JavaScript. On the other hand objects can be thought of as associative arrays.\nThe most important point however is that there are no classes in JavaScript because JavaScript is a prototypal object oriented language. This means that objects in JavaScript directly inherit from other objects. Hence we don't need classes.

For the distance, you need accurate parallactic measurement, which come in with your orbital period.\nFor a typical Gaia-star with several measurement per year, you'll get 5 values of the parallax after 5 years of time, which you then average. If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5\/168 th of one paralactic measurement.\nIt simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere.

The following generalizations hold true in the vast majority of variations in practical use, but many points can be circumvented.\nFinite Difference\nPros\n\n* efficient quadrature-free implementation\n* aspect ratio independence and local conservation for certain schemes (e.g. MAC for incompressible flow)\n* robust nonlinear methods for transport (e.g. ENO\/WENO)\n* M-matrix for some problems\n* discrete maximum principle for some problems (e.g. mimetic finite differences)\n* diagonal (usually identity) mass matrix\n* inexpensive nodal residual permits efficient nonlinear multigrid (FAS)\n* cell-wise Vanka smoothers give efficient matrix-free smoothers for incompressible flow\n\nCons\n\n* more difficult to implement \"physics\"\n* staggered grids are sometimes quite technical\n* higher than second order on unstructured grids is difficult\n* no Galerkin orthogonality, so convergence may be more difficult to prove\n* not a Galerkin method, so discretization and adjoints do not commute (relevant to optimization and inverse problems)\n* self-adjoint continuum problems often yield non-symmetric matrices\n* solution is only defined pointwise, so reconstruction at arbitrary locations is not uniquely defined\n* boundary conditions tend to be complicated to implement\n* discontinuous coefficients usually make the methods first order\n* stencil grows if physics includes \"cross terms\"\n\nFinite Element\nPros\n\n* Galerkin orthogonality (discrete solution to coercive problems is within a constant of the best solution in the space)\n* simple geometric flexibility\n* discontinuous Galerkin offers robust transport algorithm, arbitrary order on unstructured grids\n* cellwise entropy inequality guaranteeing $L^2$ stability holds independent of mesh, dimension, order of accuracy, and presence of discontinuous solutions, without needing nonlinear limiters\n* easy of implementing boundary conditions\n* can choose conservation statement by choosing test space\n* discretization and adjoints commute (for Galerkin methods)\n* elegant foundation in functional analysis\n* at high order, local kernels can exploit tensor product structure that is missing with FD\n* Lobatto quadrature can make methods energy-conserving (assuming a symplectic time integrator)\n* high order accuracy even with discontinuous coefficients, as long as you can align to boundaries\n* discontinuous coefficients inside elements can be accommodated with XFEM\n* easy to handle multiple inf-sup conditions\n\nCons\n\n* many elements have trouble at high aspect ratio\n* continuous FEM has trouble with transport (SUPG is diffusive and oscillatory)\n* DG usually has more degrees of freedom for same accuracy (though HDG is much better)\n* continuous FEM does not provide cheap nodal problems, so nonlinear smoothers have much poorer constants\n* usually more nonzeros in assembled matrices\n* have to choose between consistent mass matrix (some nice properties, but has full inverse, thus requiring an implicit solve per time step) and lumped mass matrix.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How important is multithreading in the current software industry?","response":"It is extremely important.\nWhat is more important though is to understand that multithreading is just one way to solve the asynchrony problem. The technical environment in which many people are now writing software differs from the historical software development environment (of monolithic applications performing batch computations) in two key ways:\n\n* Many-core machines are now common. We can no longer expect clock speeds or transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude. The price of computation will continue to fall, but it will fall because of lots of parallelism. We're going to have to find a way to take advantage of that power.\n* Computers are now heavily networked and modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.\n\nFrom a computational standpoint, these two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea: information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion. Whether the information you need is being computed on another chip in your machine or on a chip halfway around the world doesn't really matter. Either way, your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second waiting for information when it could be doing useful work. \nSo what matters now, and what will matter even more in the future, is not multithreading per se, but rather, dealing with asynchrony. Multithreading is just one way to do that -- a complicated, error-prone way that is only going to get more complicated and more error-prone as weak-memory-model chips become more widely used. \nThe challenge for tools vendors is to come up with some way better than multithreading for our customers to deal with the asynchronous infrastructure they'll be using in the future.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Many people are now writing software in a technical environment.","max_prob":36.7887687683,"ccp":-0.1915822531},{"claim":"The current technical environment differs from the historical software development environment.","max_prob":37.4172172546,"ccp":-0.1788384102},{"claim":"The historical software development environment involved monolithic applications.","max_prob":19.6701450348,"ccp":-0.1647291485},{"claim":"The historical software development environment involved performing batch computations.","max_prob":30.8140010834,"ccp":-0.0468175391},{"claim":"Many-core machines are common now.","max_prob":20.7059516907,"ccp":-0.8369718481},{"claim":"We can no longer expect clock speeds to increase by orders of magnitude.","max_prob":23.8252105713,"ccp":-0.0937242431},{"claim":"We can no longer expect transistor densities to increase by orders of magnitude.","max_prob":21.085931778,"ccp":-0.030575389},{"claim":"The price of computation will continue to fall.","max_prob":17.2723064423,"ccp":-0.000533567},{"claim":"The price of computation will fall because of lots of parallelism.","max_prob":31.8187999725,"ccp":-0.0008155625},{"claim":"Computers are now heavily networked.","max_prob":13.719918251,"ccp":-0.0750701025},{"claim":"Modern applications rely upon being able to fetch rich information from a variety of sources.","max_prob":44.1460533142,"ccp":-0.4751036377},{"claim":"There are two factors being discussed from a computational standpoint.","max_prob":18.2461280823,"ccp":-0.0047464615},{"claim":"These two factors essentially boil down to the same core idea.","max_prob":25.2421646118,"ccp":-0.2989353045},{"claim":"The core idea is that information increasingly will be available in an asynchronous fashion.","max_prob":39.4003181458,"ccp":-0.0778570046},{"claim":"Your processor is sitting there burning billions of cycles a second.","max_prob":34.3046302795,"ccp":-0.0274425755},{"claim":"Your processor is waiting for information.","max_prob":12.9628067017,"ccp":-0.301035336},{"claim":"Your processor could be doing useful work.","max_prob":11.6045980453,"ccp":-0.3377542043},{"claim":"Multithreading is one way to do something.","max_prob":2.8472743034,"ccp":-0.9995410202},{"claim":"Multithreading is complicated.","max_prob":11.6786766052,"ccp":-0.4419622721},{"claim":"Multithreading is error-prone.","max_prob":1.8687976599,"ccp":-0.8054250869},{"claim":"Multithreading is going to get more complicated.","max_prob":5.0678825378,"ccp":-0.7856440443},{"claim":"Multithreading is going to get more error-prone.","max_prob":5.0369706154,"ccp":-0.7856422822},{"claim":"Weak-memory-model chips are becoming more widely used.","max_prob":29.6778717041,"ccp":-0.0000220036}]}
{"instruction":"Is it true that the price of diamonds is based on a monopoly? And who actually runs\/owns this supposed monopoly? Is this likely to affect diamond prices if I am interested in purchasing?","response":"Yes, the De Beers Group of Companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century. They still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing (particularly with the slogan \"A Diamond is Forever\") has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society.\nThe intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect, but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds.\nThe larger the diamond, the more likely it is to have flaws, so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 carats or greater, you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones.\nSome other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design. This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute. In the years to come, you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers' prices.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

How can I mount this image?","response":"You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \"FAT32\", and the other one \"Linux\". Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```\/mnt\/img\/one``` and ```\/mnt\/img\/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/two\n```\nIf you get an \"overlapping loop\" error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\n    -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\n```\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \nYou can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the ```-r``` (read-only) switch too.  If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the ```.img``` file.\nNote that the first partition is probably mounted on ```\/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How does immersion passively help with learning a language?","response":"There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive\u2014to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

What is ```exit``` exiting out of, if not the script?","response":"```()``` runs commands in the subshell, so by ```exit``` you are exiting from subshell and returning to the parent shell. Use braces ```{}``` if you want to run commands in the current shell.\nFrom bash manual:\n\n  (list) list is executed in a subshell environment. Variable assignments  and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The  return status is the exit status of list.\n  { list; } list  is simply executed in the current shell environment. list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.  The return  status  is the exit status of list.  Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is  permitted  to  be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the shell syntax is quite consistent and the subshell participates also in the other ```()``` constructs like command substitution (also with the old-style ````..```` syntax) or process substitution, so the following won't exit from the current shell either:\n```echo $(exit)\ncat <(exit)\n```\n\nWhile it may be obvious that subshells are involved when commands are placed explicitly inside ```()```, the less visible fact is that they are also spawned in these other structures:\n\n* command started in the background\n```exit &\n```\ndoesn't exit the current shell because (after ```man bash```)\n\n  If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.\n\n* the pipeline\n```exit | echo foo\n```\nstill exits only from the subshell.\nHowever different shells behave differently in this regard. For example ```bash``` puts all components of the pipeline into separate subshells (unless you use the ```lastpipe``` option in invocations where job control is not enabled), but AT&T ```ksh``` and ```zsh``` run the last part inside the current shell (both behaviours are allowed by POSIX). Thus\n```exit | exit | exit\n```\ndoes basically nothing in bash, but exits from the zsh because of the last ```exit```.\n* ```coproc exit``` also runs ```exit``` in a subshell.\n","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Reasoning,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"There is a transmission from a satellite to a receiver.","max_prob":15.2525653839,"ccp":-0.1648170644},{"claim":"There is nothing being transmitted in the opposite direction.","max_prob":14.7218866348,"ccp":-0.0107248957},{"claim":"The signal from GPS satellites is very faint.","max_prob":18.4028911591,"ccp":-0.0207257381},{"claim":"Each GPS satellite has to broadcast a signal to about half the planet.","max_prob":30.1971340179,"ccp":-0.0349333908},{"claim":"GPS satellites are powered only by solar panels.","max_prob":11.6601352692,"ccp":-0.1288802319},{"claim":"The broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code'.","max_prob":21.9043369293,"ccp":-0.0010165524},{"claim":"The 'Gold Code' is used in the case of the oldest public GPS signal.","max_prob":55.4700431824,"ccp":-0.0001274894},{"claim":"Part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver.","max_prob":27.2831821442,"ccp":-0.8756365395},{"claim":"The GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is.","max_prob":23.0130252838,"ccp":-0.6671739422},{"claim":"The GPS receiver tracks the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.","max_prob":26.0550365448,"ccp":-0.0520757993},{"claim":"Multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency.","max_prob":20.0254592896,"ccp":-0.5337298615},{"claim":"Satellites can use different gold codes.","max_prob":6.4781837463,"ccp":-0.4270097278},{"claim":"Newer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques.","max_prob":36.1429443359,"ccp":-0.6300366668}]}
{"instruction":"Why is iceberg lettuce bad for rabbits?","response":"In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value. A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc.\nIf you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%.\nMost importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium.\nOther effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach.\nIn addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset.\nFinally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that\n\nRabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities.\n\nRSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths\nBut this is disputed because\n\nLettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa.\nLactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name \u2018lettuce opium\u2019.\nEdible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium.\n\nLettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition).\nIt is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce.

{"instruction":"Millions of colors in the visible spectrum can be generated by mixing red, green and blue - the RGB color system. Is there a basic set of smells that, when mixed, can yield all, or nearly all detectable smells ?","response":"There are about 100 (Purves, 2001) to 400 (Zozulya et al., 2001) functional olfactory receptors in man. While the total tally of olfactory receptor genes exceeds 1000, more than half of them are inactive pseudogenes. The combined activity of the expressed functional receptors accounts for the number of distinct odors that can be discriminated by the human olfactory system, which is estimated to be about 10,000 (Purves, 2001).\nDifferent receptors are sensitive to subsets of chemicals that define a \u201ctuning curve.\u201d Depending on the particular olfactory receptor molecules they contain, some olfactory receptor neurons exhibit marked selectivity to particular chemical stimuli, whereas others are activated by a number of different odorant molecules. In addition, olfactory receptor neurons can exhibit different thresholds for a particular odorant. How these olfactory responses encode a specific odorant is a complex issue that is unlikely to be explained at the level of the primary neurons (Purves, 2001). \nSo in a way, the answer to your question is yes, as there are approximately 100 to 400 olfactory receptors. Just like the photoreceptors in the visual system, each sensory neuron in the olfactory epithelium in the nose expresses only a single receptor gene (Kimball). In the visual system for color vision there are just three (red, green and blue cones - RGB) types of sensory neurons, so it's a bit more complicated in olfaction.\nReferences\n- Purves et al, Neuroscience, 2nd ed.

{"instruction":"Do you bleed to death after your penis is cut off?","response":"Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc). Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure.

{"instruction":"I read in the Essential C# 3.0 and .NET 3.5 book that:\n\n  GetHashCode()\u2019s returns over the life of a particular object should be\n  constant (the same value), even if the object\u2019s data changes. In many\n  cases, you should cache the method return to enforce this.\n\nIs this a valid guideline?\nI have tried a couple built-in types in .NET and they didn't behave like this.","response":"The answer is mostly, it is a valid guideline, but perhaps not a valid rule. It also doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nThe point being made is that for mutable types, you cannot base the hash code on the mutable data because two equal objects must return the same hash code and the hash code has to be valid for the lifetime of the object. If the hash code changes, you end up with an object that gets lost in a hashed collection because it no longer lives in the correct hash bin.\nFor example, object A returns hash of 1. So, it goes in bin 1 of the hash table. Then you change object A such that it returns a hash of 2. When a hash table goes looking for it, it looks in bin 2 and can't find it - the object is orphaned in bin 1.  This is why the hash code must not change for the lifetime of the object, and just one reason why writing GetHashCode implementations is a pain in the butt.\n\nA guideline is just a guide, not a rule. In reality, ```GetHashCode``` only has to follow these guidelines when things expect the object to follow the guidelines, such as when it is being stored in a hash table. If you never intend to use your objects in hash tables (or anything else that relies on the rules of ```GetHashCode```), your implementation doesn't need to follow the guidelines. When you see \"for the lifetime of the object\", you should read \"for the time the object needs to co-operate with hash tables\" or similar. Like most things, ```GetHashCode``` is about knowing when to break the rules.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Especially in blitz or bullet games, it is possible that a player makes an illegal move, for example castles through check. \n\n* If the opponent does notice the illegal move, then as far as I know the first player is obliged to make a legal move with the same piece, if one exists. What if there are no legal moves? \n* What if the opponent, being in time pressure, doesn't notice the illegal move and makes a move. What happens after they realize that? Does the person who made the illegal move forfeit? Or is the whole game cancelled?\n\nAre there any standard rules for these kinds of situations?","response":"This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"This applies to over the board games.","max_prob":8.0709686279,"ccp":-0.3547741301},{"claim":"Online chess servers prevent illegal moves.","max_prob":14.660200119,"ccp":-0.271204927},{"claim":"There is a standard time control game.","max_prob":15.7514066696,"ccp":-0.0299632581},{"claim":"The game is played under USCF rules.","max_prob":10.0311374664,"ccp":-0.0717385176},{"claim":"An illegal move can be noticed by one of the players.","max_prob":11.0181884766,"ccp":-0.2075759224},{"claim":"When an illegal move is noticed, a few things happen.","max_prob":23.0213661194,"ccp":-0.0075558651},{"claim":"The move in question is illegal.","max_prob":1.7414741516,"ccp":-0.3165762845},{"claim":"The illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.","max_prob":19.5576763153,"ccp":-0.0430474551},{"claim":"If the offending player has pressed the clock, a two-minute \"bonus\" is added to the opponent's clock.","max_prob":38.195224762,"ccp":-0.0572262845},{"claim":"The two-minute \"bonus\" penalizes the offending player.","max_prob":21.1536769867,"ccp":-0.0014660125},{"claim":"A player can complete an illegal move by pressing the clock.","max_prob":21.3165855408,"ccp":-0.8231572884},{"claim":"If a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, they have an obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible.","max_prob":44.6105499268,"ccp":-0.8199196733},{"claim":"There is a standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a.","max_prob":37.0458679199,"ccp":-0.0000001618},{"claim":"The standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a is two minutes added to the opponent's clock.","max_prob":40.909122467,"ccp":-0.0000000755},{"claim":"If a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies.","max_prob":61.4998550415,"ccp":-0.0025745993},{"claim":"The WBCA stands for the World Blitz Chess Association.","max_prob":14.7855653763,"ccp":-0.0002874799},{"claim":"The WBCA has rules.","max_prob":15.1614408493,"ccp":-0.0001837002},{"claim":"According to the WBCA rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.","max_prob":29.5875053406,"ccp":-0.0001609722},{"claim":"Blitz is a much faster pace game.","max_prob":14.7786216736,"ccp":-0.6773573189},{"claim":"The illegal move must be noticed within two moves in blitz.","max_prob":19.6889915466,"ccp":-0.2241621567},{"claim":"A game starts.","max_prob":3.2037556171,"ccp":-0.9463325586},{"claim":"Both players make a move.","max_prob":7.0659041405,"ccp":-0.4472313826},{"claim":"A result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded.","max_prob":18.2672595978,"ccp":-0.5434580817}]}

If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That\u2019s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What does strength refer to in mathematics? Is it a formal idea?","response":"Suppose you have a theorem that says \"If $X$, then $Y$.\"  There are two ways to strengthen such a theorem:\n\n* Assume less.  If you can reduce the number of hypotheses, but still prove the same conclusion, then you have proved a more \"powerful\" result (in the sense that it applies in more situations).\n* Prove more.  If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.  Then the internal angle bisectors of the vertices intersect at four points $WXYZ$, which are the vertices of a rectangle.\n\n(You need the condition that $ABCD$ is not a square because if it is a square then all four angle bisectors coincide at a single point.)\nHere are a few ways to strengthen the theorem:\n\n* The hypothesis \"$ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle\" can be relaxed to the more general \"$ABCD$ is a (non-rhombic) parallelogram\".  The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Math","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Does vegetarianism affect life expectancy?\nIs an average vegetarian supposed to live longer just because of their diet?","response":"Yes, according to a paper by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.\n\n> Results: Our review of the 6 studies found the following trends: 1) a very low meat intake was associated with a significant decrease in risk of death in 4 studies, a nonsignificant decrease in risk of death in the fifth study, and virtually no association in the sixth study; 2) 2 of the studies in which a low meat intake significantly decreased mortality risk also indicated that a longer duration (\u2265 2 decades) of adherence to this diet contributed to a significant decrease in mortality risk and a significant 3.6-y (95% CI: 1.4, 5.8 y) increase in life expectancy; and 3) the protective effect of a very low meat intake seems to attenuate after the ninth decade. Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* less meat = less risk of death,\n* less meat for a longer time = an average of a 3 year longer lifespan + less risk of death,\n* after 90 years of no meat it stops decreasing your risk of death.\n\n\n> Conclusion: Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.\n\nSo yes, scientific research says that vegetarianism could help you live longer, but it primarily decreases your risk of death.

Because it behaves exactly like the companion, but it must have a name.\nIs there maybe a difference in its \"static\" (I'm from the java side) lifecycle? ","response":"There are two different types of ```object``` uses, expression and declaration.\nObject Expression\nAn object expression can be used when a class needs slight modification, but it's not necessary to create an entirely new subclass for it.  Anonymous inner classes are a good example of this.\n```button.setOnClickListener(object: View.OnClickListener() {\n    override fun onClick(view: View) {\n        \/\/ click event\n    }\n})\n```\nOne thing to watch out for is that anonymous inner classes can access variables from the enclosing scope, and these variables do not have to be ```final```.  This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        \/\/ return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.  Here's an example of a class with instance methods and companion methods.\n```class MyClass {\n  companion object MyCompanionObject {\n    fun actsAsStatic() {\n      \/\/ do stuff\n    }\n  }\n  fun instanceMethod() {\n    \/\/ do stuff\n  }\n}\n```\nInvoking the instance method would look like this.\n```var myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.instanceMethod()\n```\nInvoking the companion object method would look like this.\n```MyClass.actsAsStatic()\n```\nSee the Kotlin docs for more info.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I've rooted my phone.  Now what?  What do I gain from rooting?","response":"In few words, rooting an Android system means overcome the limitations that were imposed over it by the manufacturer. People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege.

What makes this problem different? What makes it so easy (NL-Complete - even easier than P)?","response":"Here is a further intuitive and unpretentious explanation along the lines of MGwynne's answer.\nWith $2$-SAT, you can only express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b$, where $a$ and $b$ are literals. More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals. Now you are in trouble: if you set $a$ to true, then either $b$ or $c$ must be true, but which one? You have to make a choice: you have 2 possibilities. Here is where case-multiplication becomes possible, and where the combinatorial explosion arises.\nIn other words, $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility, while $2$-SAT doesn't have such ability. It is precisely such presence of more than one possibility ($2$ possibilities in case of $3$-SAT, $k-1$ possibilities in case of $k$-SAT) that causes the typical combinatorial explosion of NP-complete problems.

{"instruction":"Why isn't Sectumsempra an Unforgivable Curse?","response":"Not many people knew Sectumsempra - they'd need to know it exists to  ban it.\nSeverus Snape invented Sectumsempra while at Hogwarts, and wrote it down in his Potions book. He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n\u201cHarry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned \u2018For Enemies\u2019, that he had marked a few weeks previously.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n\u201cNow \u2026 those three curses \u2013 Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus \u2013 are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.\u201d - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n\u201cPushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry\u2019s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy\u2019s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nWhile the wounds from Sectumsempra can't be healed by simple healing spells, they can in fact be healed by the countercurse.\nSo - Sectumsempra likely wouldn't be made Unforgivable if the Ministry knew it.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Note that it may be fine to use Sleep in pure console application as there are no \"events\" to handle or on separate thread (also ```Task.Delay``` is better option).\nIn addition to timers and ```Sleep``` you can use ```Task.Delay``` which is asynchronous version of ```Sleep``` that does not block thread from processing events (if used properly - don't turn it into infinite sleep with ```.Wait()```). \n``` public async void ClickHandler(...)\n {\n      \/\/ whatever you need to do before delay goes here\n      await Task.Delay(2000);\n      \/\/ whatever you need to do after delay.\n }\n```\nThe same ```await Task.Delay(2000)``` can be used in a ```Main``` method of a console application if you use C# 7.1 (Async main on MSDN blogs).\nNote: delaying operation with ```Sleep``` has benefit of avoiding race conditions that comes from potentially starting multiple operations with timers\/```Delay```.

The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting.

They often will grant the waiver if it's the first time, the absence is not too much over a year, and\/or there is a good reason for not returning earlier (e.g. COVID-19).

{"instruction":"What is the LXX and why is it so noteworthy that there is a Greek translation of the OT? Wouldn't it be better to directly reference manuscripts in the original languages?","response":"Before 1947, a good case could be made that the Septuagint represented a more ancient tradition than the Masoretic versions of the Tanakh.  Since the Septuagint was produced before 132 BCE (and probably in the 3rd century BCE) and the earliest known Masoretic manuscripts date to the 10th century CE, the Greek translation might have fossilized an early rendering of the Scriptures while the Hebrew continued to be copied and potentially altered.  To further support the primacy of the Septuagint, the early Christian and Hellenistic Jewish texts, tended to use that translation rather go back to Hebrew sources.\nAn interesting counter-argument arises from the observation that during the 600 years from Jerome's translation into Latin (the Vulgate) to the earliest Masoretic manuscripts, the Hebrew seems to have been faithfully copied.  That suggests that Jewish scribes were exceptionally careful to duplicate their scriptures.\nAfter 1947, the evidence changed.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n  [Most] of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\".\n\nAnother another article describes the meaning of the categories in detail.\nA few caveats are in order:\n\n* Surveying the Qumran about religious texts seems something akin to surveying a hippie commune about political issues&mdash;you're likely to experience some bias.  If we could obtain a similar collection from Jerusalem, we'd likely find more agreement and likely the side of MT.  Given the diversity in non-Scriptural texts, 60% seems quite solid support.\n* While it's unlikely, there exists a chronological possibility the scrolls associated with the Septuagint-aligned Hebrew were influenced by the Greek.  (Any references one way or the other would be appreciated.) \n\nWhat remains therefore is a window into the community of Alexandrian Jews that produced the translation.  For those who are interested in the development of Jewish belief, that can be extremely useful.  N. T. Wright's book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, shows that the LXX translators chose to interpret key texts from Daniel and Ezekiel about the resurrection as literal rather than metaphorical.  He argues from this that belief in bodily resurrection was more common in Jesus' day than other scholars assert.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I'm no expert in darkroom photography, but it seems a little odd that there is a type of light that doesn't affect film or developing paper etc. So why is a dark-room safelight safe?","response":"Photo films and papers are made from salts of silver that naturally only darken when exposed to violet or blue light. In the early days of photography, this was all that was available. Therefore these films and papers are able to be handled under any light source that does not radiate blue light. By the way, the violet and blue frequencies of light are the shortest, and are the most energetic when it comes to inducing a chemical change. These early films and papers could all be be handled safely under red light as well as yellow light. These lamps do not emit violet or blue. \n\nThese blue-sensitive-only films did an OK job, with some exceptions. Women\u2019s faces with cosmetics, like lipstick and rouge on the cheeks, came out weird. Warm tones reproduced super dark, and most times lips and cheeks turned black, void of detail on the finished picture. The bottom line is, many colors in nature reproduced incorrectly with this early blue-sensitive-only film. \n\nThe cure was accidental. Professor Hermann Vogel at Berlin Technical was trying to solve the problem of halation. This results when taking a picture of bright objects, like light sources or gemstones and the like. These objects play on the film with lots of light energy. This energy often goes completely through the film and hits something behind the film. The light is then reflected back into the film. The result is a halo around bright objects. The professor had one of his students dye the silver salts yellow, thinking the yellow dye would filter out the annoying reflected blue from the rear. He tried this dyed film and it did the trick, plus the film gained sensitivity to green light. He named this blue\/green sensitive film orthochromatic (Latin for correct color). The year was 1857, and the quality of film reproducing the colors of nature moved forward by a big leap. \n\nA few years later, one of his graduate students, experimenting with different dyes, discovered how to make films sensitive to blue, green and red light. This film was called panchromatic (the pan prefix in Greek means \"all\"). Thus panchromatic film reproduces all colors found in nature with high accuracy. The bad news was, the darkroom folks were forced to give up the red and yellow safelight. A super dim green safelight could be used for a short period of time during developing. \n\nPhoto papers remained insensitive to red for the most part - no need, as they work OK with just blue and green sensitivity. Modern variable contrast photo papers have two sensitive coats, one for blue light and one for green light. We can use a safelight on these papers; it is amber with reduced brilliance. \n\nFilms and papers that make color pictures are panchromatic, and most safelights are not safe. We can use infrared lamps with a specialized night vision infrared scope to view and handle most panchromatic films and papers, because these materials have low sensitivity to infrared.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Is Australia the biggest island or the smallest continent? Is Antarctica an ice-locked archipelago or a continent? Are the Americas one continent or two?

{"instruction":"What's the difference between ASCII and Unicode?","response":"ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127.  It can fit in a single 8-bit byte, the values 128 through 255 tended to be used for other characters. With incompatible choices, causing the code page disaster.  Text encoded in one code page cannot be read correctly by a program that assumes or guessed at another code page.\n\nUnicode came about to solve this disaster. Version 1 started out with 65536 code points, commonly encoded in 16 bits. Later extended in version 2 to 1.1 million code points. The current version is 6.3, using 110,187 of the available 1.1 million code points. That doesn't fit in 16 bits anymore.\nEncoding in 16-bits was common when v2 came around, used by Microsoft and Apple operating systems for example. And language runtimes like Java. The v2 spec came up with a way to map those 1.1 million code points into 16-bits. An encoding called UTF-16, a variable length encoding where one code point can take either 2 or 4 bytes.  The original v1 code points take 2 bytes, added ones take 4.  \n\nAnother variable length encoding that's very common, used in *nix operating systems and tools is UTF-8, a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, the original ASCII codes take 1 byte the rest take more.  The only non-variable length encoding is UTF-32, takes 4 bytes for a code point. Not often used since it is pretty wasteful. There are other ones, like UTF-1 and UTF-7, widely ignored.\nAn issue with the UTF-16\/32 encodings is that the order of the bytes will depend on the endian-ness of the machine that created the text stream. So add to the mix UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.\n\nHaving these different encoding choices brings back the code page disaster to some degree, along with heated debates among programmers which UTF choice is \"best\". Their association with operating system defaults pretty much draws the lines. One counter-measure is the definition of a BOM, the Byte Order Mark, a special codepoint (U+FEFF, zero width space) at the beginning of a text stream that indicates how the rest of the stream is encoded. It indicates both the UTF encoding and the endianess and is neutral to a text rendering engine. Unfortunately it is optional and many programmers claim their right to omit it so accidents are still pretty common.","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"Given that Kohn-Sham DFT is strictly a ground-state method (at 0 K), how is it sufficient to describe materials in real-life applications?","response":"These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I don't really get the difference between gain and volume boost.\n\nSo if I understand correctly, gain directly boosts a signal from a line or input while volume handles the output. Volume isn't really for boosting either.\nWould this mean, in most settings, getting 'close to' as much gain as possible without any hiss\/background noise is ideal?","response":"Here's a brief overview to get you started. Hopefully this helps!\n\n* 'Gain' controls are typically used to get a good input level. So for example if you had a microphone with a very low output signal, you would boost the gain to get a better level into your mixing desk or audio interface. If you had a synthesizer plugged in you might need to turn the gain down to stop the signal distorting. Gain controls are often controlling an amplifier behind the scenes - i.e. your signal can 'gain' strength after going through the gain stage of your audio equipment. So gain is usually the first control in the signal path of your recording equipment. \n\n* 'Volume' controls on the other hand tend to be at the end of the signal chain and are more likely to be attenuating rather than amplifying the signal. So on a mixing desk, having got a good level from each input at the gain stage, you use the volume faders to adjust the relative volumes of each channel to achieve a good mix. You are not typically amplifying those signals any more though.\n\nA guitar amp is a good example of how this works. The first control is often called \"Gain\" or 'drive' and guitarists often deliberately turn this really high to get a nice distorted sound from a tube preamp. However, the final control is called Volume and governs simply how loud the sound coming out of your speaker is. With gain right up and volume low you can play distorted sounds without annoying the neighbours. With gain low and volume high you get a loud sound but no distortion.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand.

Early graphics cards had virtually no callable code associated with them at all, the concept of \"drivers\" had not quite become a reality yet. There was the concept of a Video BIOS, which were extensions to the ```INT 10h``` BIOS video services, that were effectively limited to initialization and switching video modes. \nInstead, graphics cards, at least in DOS land, all had memory mapped display RAM, and extensive documentation was available about exactly how setting various bits in display RAM would affect the pixels that appeared on the screen. There were no drawing APIs to call, if you wanted something to appear on the screen (whether it be a pixel, a character, a line, a circle, a sprite, etc) you would write the code to move the bytes into the right places in display RAM. Entire books were written about how to write efficient code to draw graphics.\nThere were some systems like the Borland Graphics Interface that abstracted graphics drawing primitives into an API with different drivers that one could call to draw things on different graphics cards. However, these were typically slower than what would be required for building action type games.\nAn action game would typically be optimized for a particular graphics display mode on a particular card. For example, a popular display mode was VGA 640x480 with 16 colors. This would be listed in the software requirements, and you needed to have the right hardware to support the game.

{"instruction":"What are Null Pointer Exceptions (```java.lang.NullPointerException```) and what causes them?\n\nWhat methods\/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?","response":"There are two overarching types of variables in Java:\n\n1. Primitives: variables that contain data. If you want to manipulate the data in a primitive variable you can manipulate that variable directly. By convention primitive types start with a lowercase letter. For example variables of type `int` or `char` are primitives.\n\n2. References: variables that contain the memory address of an `Object` i.e. variables that refer to an `Object`. If you want to manipulate the `Object` that a reference variable refers to you must dereference it. Dereferencing usually entails using `.` to access a method or field, or using `[` to index an array. By convention reference types are usually denoted with a type that starts in uppercase. For example variables of type `Object` are references.\n\nConsider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type `int` and don't initialize it:\n```\nint x;\nint y = x + x;\n```\nThese two lines will crash the program because no value is specified for `x` and we are trying to use `x`'s value to specify `y`. All primitives have to be initialized to a usable value before they are manipulated.\n\nNow here is where things get interesting. Reference variables can be set to `null` which means \"I am referencing nothing\". You can get a `null` value in a reference variable if you explicitly set it that way, or a reference variable is uninitialized and the compiler does not catch it (Java will automatically set the variable to `null`).\n\nIf a reference variable is set to null either explicitly by you or through Java automatically, and you attempt to dereference it you get a `NullPointerException`.\n\nThe `NullPointerException` (NPE) typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying to use the contents of the variable. So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.\n\nTake the following code:\n```\nInteger num;\nnum = new Integer(10);\n```\nThe first line declares a variable named `num`, but it does not actually contain a reference value yet. Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to `null`.\n\nIn the second line, the `new` keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type `Integer`, and the `reference` variable `num` is assigned to that `Integer` object.\n\nIf you attempt to dereference `num` before creating the object you get a `NullPointerException`. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that \"`num may not have been initialized`,\" but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object.\n\nFor instance, you may have a method as follows:\n```\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n   \/\/ Do something to obj, assumes obj is not null\n   obj.myMethod();\n}\n```\nIn which case, you are not creating the object `obj`, but rather assuming that it was created before the `doSomething()` method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this:\n```\ndoSomething(null);\n```\nIn which case, `obj` is `null`, and the statement `obj.myMethod()` will throw a `NullPointerException`.\n\nIf the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object as the above method does, it is appropriate to throw the `NullPointerException` because it's a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes.\n\nIn addition to `NullPointerException`'s thrown as a result of the method's logic, you can also check the method arguments for `null` values and throw NPEs explicitly by adding something like the following near the beginning of a method:\n```\n\/\/ Throws an NPE with a custom error message if obj is null\nObjects.requireNonNull(obj, \"obj must not be null\");\n```\n\nNote that it's helpful to say in your error message clearly which object cannot be `null`. The advantage of validating this is that 1) you can return your own clearer error messages and 2) for the rest of the method you know that unless `obj` is reassigned, it is not null and can be dereferenced safely.\n\nAlternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, `doSomething()` could be written as:\n```\n\/**\n  * @param obj An optional foo for ____. May be null, in which case\n  *  the result will be ____.\n  *\/\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n    if(obj == null) {\n       \/\/ Do something\n    } else {\n       \/\/ Do something else\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, how to pinpoint the exception & cause using Stack Trace:\n\n> What methods\/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?\n\nSonar with find bugs can detect NPE.

Before translating the writings on the headpiece that give the height of the Staff of Ra, Imam warns Indy not to touch the Ark or look at it when it is opened.\n   [Source]\n  The next scene involving this Ark subplot is when Sallah and Indy remove the Ark from the Well of the Souls. When Sallah first sees it he reaches out to touch it. Indy stops him before he does and reminds him of Imam's warning. Then they insert long poles through each side of the Ark to lift it out of its crypt.\n   [Source]\n  Notice that nobody ever touches the Ark throughout the rest of the film until the finale.\n\nAnd from the Bible (King James Version):\n\n  1 Samuel 6:19:\n   And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men...\n  2 Samuel 6:6-7\n  And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

{"instruction":"What is likely to happen when you plug two ends of a network cable to a single switch\/router? Will this create problems on the network, or just be ignored?","response":"It depends on the router\/switch. \nIf it's \"Managed\" - Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports. \n(I've only described the STP re-convergence as \"absolute insanity\" because if you're using old-style, slow, STP then re-convergence can take 30s or more, depending on network complexity.  Vendor specific STP extensions such as BackboneFast and so on will decrease this, but you might still end up with a short period of a slightly unstable network. Rapid STP is a lot quicker to converge, due to a different algorithm)\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  \nThe reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.  This is known as a \"Broadcast Storm\".\nThis can quickly use up all of a switch's CPU power, fill the transmit and receive buffers, as well as polluting the MAC address table.\nBasically, if you create a loop in the network, you'll know about it, either through monitoring (detecting a change in the STP topology [you do have monitoring, right?]), or in everything falling over dramatically.   \nIf you look at a switch that has a broadcast storm on it, you tend to find that all of the port activity lights are blinking all at the same time.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What command do I use to find the size of all the files (recursively) in a Linux or Mac OS X directory?","response":"The BSD version of ```du``` used in OS X reports size with 512-byte blocks -- the sizes are essentially rounded up to the next 512-byte value. This tells you the space on disk, which is larger than the amount of data. If you have a lot of small files, the difference can be large.\nHere's an example.\nThis is the value with regular ```du```. It's in 512-byte blocks:\n```$ du -s\n248   .\n```\nThe ```-h``` flag results in a more readable number, in kilobytes. As expected, it's half the number of 512-byte blocks:\n```$ du -hs\n124K  .\n```\nFinally, you can use ```find``` and ```awk``` to give you the sum of actual bytes in the files. This is kind of slow, but it works:\n```$ find . -type f -exec ls -l {} \\; | awk '{sum += $5} END {print sum}'\n60527\n```\nThis value matches exactly the number reported by Finder's Get Info window. (There are no weird forks or xattrs in this set of files.) It's significantly smaller than the value reported by ```du```.\nHere's how it works: it gets a list of all the files, and passes them to ```ls -l```; then ```awk``` is used to count up the bytes. The ```-type f``` flag is there so that only files (and not directories) get sent to ```ls```. Without that flag, it'll also send directory names to ```ls```, and each file will be listed twice : once as an individual file, and once as an item in the directory.\nThe GNU version of ```du``` can give values in actual bytes instead of blocks. It's unfortunate that the BSD version of ```du``` is not as flexible.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I've been writing C and C++ code for almost twenty years, but there's one aspect of these languages that I've never really understood. I've obviously used regular casts i.e.\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\n```\nall over the place, but there seem to be two other types of casts, and I don't know the difference. What's the difference between the following lines of code?\n```MyClass *m = (MyClass *)ptr;\nMyClass *m = static_cast(ptr);\nMyClass *m = dynamic_cast(ptr);\n```","response":"## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  \/\/ Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  \/\/ func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why don't toilets use saltwater?","response":"The main answer is logistical. Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping. The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate. Even with a sensible cistern that has a 2 litre &quot;half flush&quot;, that's two litres wasted every time someone pees.\nAdditionally, salt is not good for pipes. A lot of pipes, even today, are clay or concrete, and salt water is bad for both of these.

It is very, very difficult for 1st-level PCs to actually really adventure at all. Many, many groups avoid 1st for this reason (many skip 2nd too, even though it is already dramatically different). Personally, I\u2019ll include 1st level often, but the PCs basically always level-up to 2nd almost entirely on roleplaying XP.\nNote that this isn\u2019t unique to 3.5e; it goes back to the earliest days of D&D. Pathfinder, of course, inherited it from 3.5e (I don\u2019t know about PF 2e). It\u2019s also very much still true in 5e\u2014after 4e actually managed to avoid it, which may mean that this is considered a \u201cfeature\u201d by some, enough that Wizards of the Coast felt the need to restore it as part of 5e\u2019s general \u201creturn to form\u201d after the divisive fourth edition.\nAnyway, the primary causes of rusty dagger shanktown:\nHit points\nAlmost anyone can one-shot almost any 1st-level character. It\u2019s very, very easy to have 6 hp in a world where a decent, but basic, weapon\u2019s base damage averages 7. Even smaller weapons can easily deal that much damage, either through luck or skill. We expect 1st-level characters to often go down in one hit.\nA 2nd-level character can have nearly twice as much hp. Actually, could easily be twice as much, if they multiclass from a small-HD class to a large-HD class. That drastically changes the game, because suddenly you can feel reasonably confident that you aren\u2019t going to just suddenly die before anyone can do anything. Healing actually becomes relevant, where at 1st it\u2019s often too little, too late.\nNotably, this only has this effect because damage doesn\u2019t grow at the same rate. The base damage of weapons is fixed, and ability scores start at double digits but grow very slowly from there. That\u2019s the biggest chunk of early damage for most characters. Even beyond that, a lot of damage boosts\u2014inspire courage, rage, sneak attack\u2014come at 1st anyway. And monsters tend to kind of mirror these trends.\nSo what ends up happening is that a 1st-level character can\u2019t really take a chance in order to get something accomplished. A 2nd-level character can feel reasonably comfortable taking a chance at least once. That dramatically affects the style of play. At 2nd-level D&D literally feels like a different game. Really, it is a different game.\nWealth\nCharacters start with less than 200 gp worth of gear. That\u2019s not enough for a masterwork weapon, not enough even for non-masterwork medium or heavy armors, definitely not enough for any kind of magic item beyond maybe an extremely basic consumable. No 1st-level character has even their complete basic kit yet.\nThe expected wealth of a 2nd-level character is 900 gp. That can afford masterwork armor of anything short of full-plate, and for many armors leave enough left over for a masterwork weapon. Most importantly, that is enough money for a party of 4 to trivially afford a wand of cure light wounds. A wand of cure light wounds is a game-changer. It means you can easily start every fight at full hp. And with 2nd-level hp, that means you can actually take a few risks.\n2nd-level features\nThis varies considerably from one class to the next, but several classes get major class features at 2nd level. The paladin\u2019s 2nd-level feature, divine grace, might be the single greatest class feature in the game (assuming we don\u2019t count \u201cspells\u201d and the like as a singular feature). Rangers don\u2019t get their combat style until 2nd. Bards get 1st-level spells at 2nd (though inspire courage from 1st level is probably more important). Outside of core, meldshapers don\u2019t get any chakra binds until 2nd, which can leave them with zero offense at 1st. Swordsages don\u2019t get Wis-to-AC until 2nd.\nBut plenty of characters are fine from 1st, so this can vary a lot.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why does \"elite\" rhyme with \"beet\" rather than \"bite\"?","response":"This has everything to do with the following:\n\n* The language of origin of the word and\n* The point at which the word entered the English language.\n\nThe reason that the words &quot;light&quot; and &quot;might&quot; and &quot;site&quot; have a diphthong is because they were present in spoken English during the Great Vowel Shift, which started in the 1400s and continued for a few hundred years. So words that had already entered the English language underwent that change in pronunciation. Those words could be of Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, or Latin origin. We see it across the board.\nHowever, the word elite entered English towards the end of the period of the Great Vowel shift. The first attestation is in the mid 1700s (1738 in the OED). This is probably further complicated by the fact that French has long been the language of nobility, so there are certain pressures to maintain the pronunciation patterns of the origin language.\n&quot;Elite&quot; joined the party a little bit late, so its pronunciation remained rather stable.\nAs Rjpond points out, elite is a modern borrowing. Words like crime, sublime, mime, etc. are older borrowings.\nTo note: There are early occurrences of the word &quot;elite&quot; in around 1400, with the meaning of a &quot;bishop elect&quot;. This sense of the word died out and is now marked as archaic. So when &quot;elite&quot; was re-introduced (directly from French) in the 1700s, there was no existing pronunciation.\n\nSmall addendum:\nAlready existing in English is another word that already occupies the same lexical space that elite would occupy, if the pronunciation were analogized to bite: alight, which dates back to Old English. (It's a lovely word.)\nYou might say that there is some linguistic pressure to avoid creating homophones: elite vs. alight.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Some comments suggests that it is a variation of Sphere Tracing. What are the computational advantages of a such approach?","response":"## TL;DR\nThey belong to the same family of solvers, where sphere tracing is one method of ray marching, which is the family name.\n\n## Raymarching a definition\nRaymarching is a technique a bit like traditional raytracing where the surface function is not easy to solve (or impossible without numeric iterative methods). In raytracing you just look up the ray intersection, whereas in ray marching you march forward (or back and forth) until you find the intersection, have enough samples or whatever it is your trying to solve. Try to think of it like a newton-raphson method for surface finding, or summing for integrating a varying function.\n\nThis can be useful if you:\n\n* Need to render volumetrics that arenot uniform\n* Rendering implicit functions, fractals\n* Rendering other kinds of parametric surfaces where intersection is not known ahead of time, like paralax mapping\netc.\n\n\n## Sphere tracing\nSphere tracing is one possible Ray marching algorithm. Not all raymarching uses benefit form this method, as they can not be converted into this kind of scheme.\n\nSphere tracing is used for rendering implicit surfaces. Implicit surfaces are formed at some level of a continuous function. In essence solving the equation\n```F(X,Y,Z) = 0\n```\n\nBecause of how this function can be solved at each point, one can go ahead and estimate the biggest possible sphere that can fit the current march step (or if not exactly reasonably safely). You then know that next march distance is at least this big. This way you can have adaptive ray marching steps speeding up the process.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

For example, urban warfare is not the same thing as a bar brawl and both require very different skill sets to survive.  The no prior warning is utter rubbish.  There are always signs that something is about to happen.  Sure, one may not notice those and a skilled attacker will be trained in camouflaging those signs but they always are.

Do you have a fan within the apartment? Plants need air whether it is natural or even if it is coming from a fan. What type of lighting is inside the apartment?  Are you only using natural light? These are important factors to aide the growth of the plant as well. How is the temperature within the apartment? If you notice a lot of temp ups \/ downs in the area you are gardening than it is probably worth moving the garden or choosing another spot.  With apartments that becomes all the more difficult.\n\nYour plant also probably came from some nice greenhouse, an english gardens, a ray weigands, etc etc...They have plenty of light, they also have plenty of means of water and the temperature well most of this is all outside, so they have the advantage of using mother nature.  Your plant needs to adjust to these conditions.  You should try to begin to place your plants in a very lit area with as much natural wind \/ fan as possible, these plants need to breath.  If your plants are not conditioned for this type of environment you run the risk that they give up and die.\n\nWhen potting the plant ensure the actual pot is cleaned up to remove any unnecessary plant diseases from prior plants.  Look on the bottom of the actual pot, are you getting drainage?  If not drill a hole in the bottom of the pot if you can, if not toss that pot out and get you a pot that has a good amount of drainage.  Overwatering plants will destroy them, and without nature (wind, temperature, etc) the water sitting there takes all the longer to dry out.\n\nWhen it comes to veggies Tomatoes need a ton of sunlight and humidity is great for them as well.

{"instruction":"What are the advantages of studying words by their frequency?","response":"The main advantage is that by learning higher frequency words, you get a greater \"bang for your buck\" - that is, if you know the most frequent words of the language, you'll be able to understand more of the words you encounter, and therefore you gain the greatest benefit by studying those frequent words first.\nAccording to Nation & Waring (1997),  text coverage in the Brown corpus is as follows:\n\n* Most frequent 1000 words:    72.0%\n* Most frequent 2000 words:    79.7%\n* Most frequent 3000 words:    84.0%\n* Most frequent 4000 words:    86.8%.\n\nSo by learning the top 1000 words, you'll know 72% of the words in the average text you read.  But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.\nNote that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.  We don't need to understand every single word in a text in order to understand the general meaning.  Some research has investigated what percentage of words we do need to understand. Laufer and Sim (1985) suggested 65-70% should be understood as an absolute minimum for comprehension, but Laufer (1989) (as described in Hu and Nation (2000)) suggests 95% should be known for solid comprehension.  Hu and Nation (2000) suggest that 98% of words should be known for unaided comprehension.  \nAlthough learning high-frequency words is a good idea, especially when you first start learning a language, frequency is not the only consideration when choosing words to learn.  Barker (2007) suggests that \"cost\" and \"benefit\" be the primary considerations when choosing words to learn; benefit is partially defined by frequency, but also on personal needs.  \nSo it's good to learn the \"technical\" vocabulary of your major or field, and it's also useful to learn words related to your interest.  It's also beneficial to learn words with a lower \"cost\" - words that are familiar, that you've encountered a lot recently, or that just seem easy.\nAlso, although memorizing words has benefits, it is best to combine this with real exposure to words, so that you learn them naturally in real contexts.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Other than rust, corrosion, and other reactions with air that would make the use of a metal unfavorable, how do different metals affect the performance?\nLet's give Yagi an example:\nLet's say I use 4 different metals for the directors\n, reflector, and driven element.\nOne antenna made out of copper, one made out of aluminum, and one made out of a higher resistance conductor, let's say graphite (I know it would snap, I'm just talking theoretical), and iron \nOther then the metal variations, the antennas  are identical.\nSo, do different metals with different conductivity and permiability affect the performance of an antenna including gain, efficiency, impedance, elevation, or any other characteristic other then mechanical strength, and chemical reliability in open air. ","response":"Considering just electrical properties, the most significant parameter for your selection of antenna conductor is resistance. You want to keep the resistance to a minimum, because when current flows through a resistance, the electrical power is converted to heat, according to Joule heating:\n$$ P = I^2 R $$\nAny energy you use to make heat is energy you aren't using to make electromagnetic waves.\nSo first, you should consider the resistivity ($\\rho$) of various metals. A lower resistivity means you will need less of a metal to reduce the resistance to an acceptable target. Here's a selection, ordered from lowest to highest resistivity in nano-ohm-meters (n\u03a9m), of some metals you might consider using in an antenna:\n\n* Silver: 15.9\n* Copper: 16.8\n* Gold: 24.4\n* Aluminium: 26.2\n* Zinc: 59.0\n* Nickel: 69.9\n* Iron: 100\n* Tin: 109\n\nI'm not going to list stainless steel because there are so many kinds, but generally stainless steels are not great conductors, being over 100 on this scale.\nA high resistivity isn't bad in itself, because you can compensate by making the conductor thicker, and end up with the same resistance. Thus, you might think copper is the best choice (ruling out silver due to high cost), but when you start making mechanical and cost considerations, you may find aluminium is better. This is because for a sample of copper and another of aluminium of equal resistance, the aluminium sample will be bigger, but stiffer, lighter, and cheaper. \nThere's another effect to consider here: with increasing frequency, currents like to flow on the surfaces of conductors. This is called the skin effect. The current flowing only on the skin of a conductor effectively reduces the cross-sectional area, and thus the conductance.\nSince most of the RF current is only on the surface, it often makes sense to build antennas from tubing for antennas requiring rigid elements (a 440 MHz Yagi), or copper-clad steel for wire antennas requiring tensile strength (a 40 meter dipole). This saves weight and cost for a negligible increase in loss.\nMagnetic permeability is a factor in skin depth. With increasing permeability, the skin depth decreases, increasing loss. Of the metals listed above, only iron and nickel have significantly higher permeability. Iron by a factor of about 5000, and nickel by 100 to 600. You could compensate for the reduced skin depth by increasing the surface area of the conductor, but when you consider cost and mechanics, it usually makes more sense to simply avoid iron and nickel and alloys containing them.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Windows in its earliest days was simply a shell that ran on top of MS-DOS, which means that Windows 3.1 itself was actually just a standard MS-DOS application like any other.\nYet, MS-DOS is not a multitasking operating system, and at the same time, Windows applications were compiled native-code binaries that ran without any form of managed environment. So, how exactly was multitasking of Windows binaries achieved if Windows 3.1 was simply a regular old MS-DOS program itself? Are there any old technical documents still floating around that describe the early Windows architecture internally?","response":"For Win16 programs, Windows implemented co-operative multitasking. Its implementation was based upon the &quot;message loop&quot; architecture of every Windows program.\n\nThe duty of every program was to endlessly run in a loop in which a call to the ```GetMessage``` function was performed. This function call looks whether a message to this process is in the queue. If there is one, it is retrieved (```GetMessage```), optionally translated (```TranslateMessage```, done to convert keyboard shortcuts into menu actions) and finally, passed to the window procedure (```DispatchMessage```).\n\nIf there is no message available in the queue, Windows suspends the current task and gives the CPU to another task. This task will try to retrieve a message from its queue as well, yielding the CPU to another task if no message is present and so on.\n\nIf a program needed to perform background tasks while there were no pending messages in its queue, it would call ```PeekMessage``` instead of ```GetMessage```. This didn't make the task relinquish the CPU, as ```PeekMessage``` would immediately return to the caller task to inform it whether a message is available or not. This was used to time-multiplex message processing with another time-consuming task (think of a 3D program rendering but letting the user cancel that render by pressing a &quot;Cancel&quot; button).\n\nIf this time-consuming task was actually very time-consuming, a well-behaved program should call the ```Yield``` function from time to time, to relinquish the CPU and let other tasks run. A badly-behaved program could easily hog the CPU by not retrieving messages too often or by spending too much time in a window procedure function.\n\nThe situation was quite different for MS-DOS boxes. They ran using the V8086 mode of the 80386 (if Windows was running in enhanced mode). Windows-aware programs ran in the so-called System VM (Virtual Machine 1). DOS boxes ran from VM 2 upwards. DOS programs usually were badly-behaved programs, so Windows assigned each DOS box a different virtual machine. Virtual machines used pre-emptive multitasking in Windows 3.1, so each DOS box could run concurrently to others and to any Windows-aware program.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

The catch is that the more cities you build, the more culture you need to generate before you hit the next \"plateau\" of culture.\nWhat is the ideal number of cities for a cultural victory? Does it change over time? ","response":"The question you're really asking is &quot;When does the combined culture \/ turn of an additional city outstrip the increase in social policy cost incurred by founding that city?&quot;\nThe short answer is...\nWe know that adding another city increases the culture costs by approximately 30% of the base cost (that of 1 city). Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture \/ turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture \/ turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture \/ turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture \/ turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25\/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45\/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}

The App Store will then compile the bitcode down into the 64 or 32 bit executables as necessary.\n\nHowever that's not true, Bitcode and Slicing work independently: Slicing is about reducing app size and generating app bundle variants, and Bitcode is about certain binary optimizations. I've verified this by checking included architectures in executables of non-bitcode apps and founding that they only include necessary ones.\nBitcode allows other App Thinning component called Slicing to generate app bundle variants with particular executables for particular architectures, e.g. iPhone 5S variant will include only arm64 executable, iPad Mini armv7 and so on.\n\n> When to enable ENABLE_BITCODE in new Xcode?\n\n  For iOS apps, bitcode is the default, but optional. If you provide bitcode, all apps and frameworks in the app bundle need to include bitcode. For watchOS and tvOS apps, bitcode is required.\n\n> What happens to the binary when ENABLE_BITCODE is enabled in the new Xcode?\nFrom Xcode 7 reference: \n\n> Activating this setting indicates that the target or project should generate bitcode during compilation for platforms and architectures which support it.

{"instruction":"In Dupire's local volatility model, the volatility is is a deterministic function of the underlying price and time, chosen to match observed European option prices.\nTo be more specific, given a smooth surface $(K,T)\\mapsto C(K,T)$ where K is the strike and T is time to maturity. Dupire equation implies that there exits an unique continuous function $\\sigma_{loc}$ defined by\n$$\\sigma_{loc}^{2}(K,T)=\\frac{\\partial_{T}C(K,T)+rK\\partial_{K}C(K,T)}{\\frac{1}{2}K^{2}\\partial_{KK}C(K,T)}$$ for all $(K,T)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(0,\\infty)$ such that the solution to the stochastic differential equation $dS_{t}\/S_{t}=rdt+\\sigma(t,S_{t})dW_{t}$ exactly generates the European call option prices.\nWhat do the dynamics of the local volatility mean? Are dynamics equivalent to the volatility surface? Why the dynamics of local volatility model is highly unrealistic?","response":"A general model (with continuous paths) can be written\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r_t dt + \\sigma_t dW_t^S\n$$\nwhere the short rate $r_t$ and spot volatility $\\sigma_t$ are stochastic processes. \nIn the Black-Scholes model both $r$ and $\\sigma$ are deterministic functions of time (even constant in the original model). This produces a flat smile for any expiry $T$. And we have the closed form formula for option prices\n$$\n  C(t,S;T,K) = BS(S,T-t,K;\\Sigma(T,K))\n$$\nwhere $BS$ is the BS formula and $\\Sigma(T,K) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T-t}\\int_t^T \\sigma(s)^2 ds}$. This is not consistent with the smile observed on the market. In order to match market prices, one needs to use a different volatility for each expiry and strike. This is the implied volatility surface $(T,K) \\mapsto \\Sigma(T,K)$. \nIn the local volatility model, rates are deterministic, instant volatility is stochastic but there is only one source of randomness\n$$\n  \\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r(t) dt + \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) dW_t^S\n$$\nthis is a special case of the general model with\n$$\n  d\\sigma_t = (\\partial_t \\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + r(t)S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t) + \\frac{1}{2}S_t^2\\partial_S^2\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)) dt + \\frac{1}{2}S_t\\partial_S\\sigma_{Dup}(t,S_t)^2 dW_t^S\n$$\nWhat is appealing with this model is that the function $\\sigma_{Dup}$ can be perfectly calibrated to match all market vanilla prices (and quite easily too). \nThe problem is that while correlated to the spot, statistical study show that the volatility also has its own source of randomness independent of that of the spot. Mathematically, this means the instant correlation between the spot and vol is not 1 contrary to what happens in the local volatility model. \nThis can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. The forward smile. Forward implied volatility is implied from prices of forward start options: ignoring interest rates,\n$$\n  C(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K) := E^Q[(\\frac{S_{T+\\theta}}{S_{T}}-K)_+] =: C_{BS}(S=1,\\theta,K;\\Sigma(t,S;T\\to T+\\theta,K))\n$$\nAlternatively, it is sometimes defined as the expectation of implied volatility at a forward date. In a LV model, as the maturity $T$ increases but $\\theta$ is kept constant, the forward smile gets flatter and higher. This is not what we observe in the markets where the forward smile tends to be similar to the current smile.\n\nThis is because the initial smile you calibrate the model too has decreasing skew:\n$$\n\\partial_K \\Sigma(0,S;T,K) \\xrightarrow[T\\to +\\infty]{} 0\n$$ \n\n2. Smile rolling. In a LV model, smile tends to move in the opposite direction of the spot and get higher independently of the direction of the spot.\nThis is not consistent with what is observed on markets. See Hagan and al. Managing Smile Risk for the derivation. This means that\n$\\partial_S \\Sigma_{LV}(t,S;T,K)$ often has the wrong sign so your Delta will be wrong which can lead to a higher hedging error than using BS. \n3. Barrier options. In FX markets, barrier options like Double No Touch are liquid but a LV model calibrated to vanilla prices does not reproduce these prices. This is a consequence of the previous point.   \n\nThe LV model is a static model. Its whole dynamic comes from the volatility surface at time 0. But the vol surface has a dynamic that is richer than that.\nThere are alternatives using multiple factors like SV models, LSV models (parametric local vol like SABR or fully non parametric local vol), models of the joint dynamic of the spot and vol surface etc... but the LV model remains the default model in many cases due to its simplicity, its ability to calibrate the initial smile perfectly and its numerical efficiency.

{"instruction":"Can you explain why we need a large number of trees in random forest when the number of predictors is large?  How can we determine the optimal number of trees?","response":"Random forest uses bagging (picking a sample of observations rather than all of them) and random subspace method (picking a sample of features rather than all of them, in other words - attribute bagging) to grow a tree. If the number of observations is large, but the number of trees is too small, then some observations will be predicted only once or even not at all. If the number of predictors is large but the number of trees is too small, then some features can (theoretically) be missed in all subspaces used. Both cases results in the decrease of random forest predictive power. But the last is a rather extreme case, since the selection of subspace is performed at each node.\n\nDuring classification the subspace dimensionality is $\\sqrt{p}$ (rather small, $p$ is the total number of predictors) by default, but a tree contains many nodes. During regression the subspace dimensionality is $p\/3$ (large enough) by default, though a tree contains fewer nodes. So the optimal number of trees in a random forest depends on the number of predictors only in extreme cases. \n\nThe official page of the algorithm states that random forest does not overfit, and you can use as much trees as you want. But Mark R. Segal (April 14 2004. \"Machine Learning Benchmarks and Random Forest Regression.\" Center for Bioinformatics & Molecular Biostatistics) has found that it overfits for some noisy datasets. So to obtain optimal number you can try training random forest at a grid of ```ntree``` parameter (simple, but more CPU-consuming) or build one random forest with many trees with ```keep.inbag```, calculate out-of-bag (OOB) error rates for first $n$ trees (where $n$ changes from $1$ to ```ntree```) and plot OOB error rate vs. number of trees (more complex, but less CPU-consuming).","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I believe artificial intelligence (AI) term is overused nowadays. For example, people see that something is self-moving and they call it AI, even if it's on autopilot (like cars or planes) or there is some simple algorithm behind it.\nWhat are the minimum general requirements so that we can say something is AI?","response":"It's true that the term has become a buzzword, and is now widely used to a point of confusion - however if you look at the definition provided by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, they write it as follows:\n\n> We define AI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig\n\nSo the example you cite, \"autopilot for cars\/planes\", is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with autopilot for cars all the time\n\nTo answer your question, for something to be considered as \"having AI\", it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments\/circumstances in order to achieve its objective\/goal, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning\/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular neural net, through to probabilistic models like bayesian networks (belief networks) - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

This is not a trivial topic in Java, but here is a quote from Sun:\n\n> ```synchronized``` methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods.\n\nIn a very, very small nutshell: When you have two threads that are reading and writing to the same 'resource', say a variable named ```foo```, you need to ensure that these threads access the variable in an atomic way.  Without the ```synchronized``` keyword, your thread 1 may not see the change thread 2 made to ```foo```, or worse, it may only be half changed.  This would not be what you logically expect.\n\nAgain, this is a non-trivial topic in Java.

{"instruction":"Let's say that we have a gaseous or liquidus compound (I don't know if elements or compounds make a difference, take this as a thought experiment), and we have a tungsten or steel block that's 5cm (or less, you choose) thick. Is there any physical method for that gas or liquid to pass through that thick heavy metal block (not by drilling etc.)?","response":"Yes, some gases can diffuse into and through metal. It is the bane of the high-vacuum engineer's life. Hydrogen is the worst because it tends to dissociate into atoms at the surface and the nucleus, a single proton, can then leave its electron behind and wander through the metal lattice until it picks up another electron when it leaves.\n\nFor example Mu-metal, favoured for some applications, typically has to be annealed in hydrogen at high temperature. Once that is over, it can take weeks or months for the residual hydrogen to diffuse out of the metal before a high enough vacuum can be achieved and the work proceed.\n\nA &quot;virtual leak&quot; occurs where a small bubble of gas is embedded in the material inside a vacuum chamber. The leak usually happens because a tiny hole exists for the gas to diffuse out through, but sometimes the &quot;hole&quot; is no more than an ultra-thin skin of metal (invisible to the frustrated technician) and the gas diffuses through it. These little horrors can keep going for months or even years and generally mean replacing suspected parts and pumping down over and over again until the dodgy one is finally stumbled on.\n\nHelium is both monatomic and the physically smallest atom. It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

I think this happened because some people were ignorant enough to bring more bags than is allowed inside the airplane instead of sending them to cargo.

For those exit rows where you cannot put anything beneath the seat in front of you, flight attendants will generally try to help find some space somewhere for at least your small personal item, but any passenger may be required to check their bags rather than put them in the overhead bin.\nIt is entirely possible that the airline didn't enforce the bag limit, but the overhead bins can easily fill up even when the limit is strictly enforced. If every passenger, or even most passengers, brings a regulation sized carry-on on a full flight, it is obvious that many of the bags will not fit in the bins and will have to be checked.\nIn some cases, overhead bins may be marked as reserved for first class or premium economy passengers (or safety equipment, or pillows and blankets). Even in such cases, cabin crew may fill these bins with other bags in an attempt to accommodate as many passengers as possible, and a late-boarding passenger may be caught out with no space.\nIt is hard to imagine that they are likely to remove and check someone's bag so you may have that space. Overhead bin space is typically first-come first served, and at some point, they will declare the bins full and start checking bags (sometimes even before the bins are actually full). Note that if your bag must be checked, you should ensure you remove any essential items (medication, passports, keys, etc...) and any valuables, along with any hazardous material that cannot be checked, namely spare (uninstalled) lithium batteries including external power packs. \nBoarding as early as possible (which, on some airlines, could require frequent flyer status or paying an extra fee) will help secure you overhead bin space.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I am 21 years old and living in a large city in Germany where smalltalk in local markets is not a common thing.\nA new cashier joined my local food shop. She\u2019s always at the checkout and never doing stuff like sorting products or cleaning the floor where I could actually ask her out. I am quite new to relationships, but the signs she gave me are promising.\nMy question is how I can ask for her number, or ask her out for coffee while she is only sitting at the checkout? I mean there are always like 5 people before and after me, and I think it would be awkward if we are changing numbers while customers are waiting behind us.

You should check it out sometime!&quot;\nIf she is interested in you and has time, she will probably arrange to come to the event some time and you will see her there. This is preferable because she is not under obligation to behave professionally for her work and you can spend some time chatting as equals.\nAnd if that goes well, then you have created a good opportunity to ask her on a real date.

That limits us to only considering x-coordinates up to 10; any further would require making at least ten '*3' steps, eleven '\u00f73' steps, and at least nine '\u00f72' steps, putting the route definitely longer than 28.\n With our x-coordinate limited to [0,10], we now look at the bottlenecks.\n It should be clear that any shortest route must start by going from 1536 to 93312 in seven steps, and must end by going from 3888 to 1 in nine steps. These are both forced by unique bottlenecks; there is only one way to step from $(x,7)$ to $(x,6)$ and only one way to step from $(x,3)$ to $(x,2)$ in this range.\n This leaves at most twelve steps to go from 93312 to 3888. Either by observation or by pointing out that there are only two ways to go from $(x,6)$ to $(x,5)$, we can see that there are exactly two shortest routes from 93312 to 3888, and both require all twelve steps.\n Therefore, the shortest route is 28 steps, and there are exactly two ways to do so, both of which are described in Jo's solution and below the chart.    \n","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why is %s better than + for concatenation in python?","response":"There are several benefits of using ```%s``` over ```+``` for string concatenation in Python:\n* Readability. The format string syntax is more readable, as it separates style from the data. Also, in Python, ```%s``` syntax will automatically coerce any non ```str``` types to ```str```; while concatenation only works with ```str```, and you can't concatenate ```str``` with ```int```.\n* Performance. In Python ```str``` is immutable, so the left and right string have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenation. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you will be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters, instead of just 40 characters. And things gets quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases. Java optimizes this case some of the times by transforming the series of concatenation to use ```StringBuilder```, but CPython doesn't.\n* For some use cases, the logging library provide an API that uses format string to create the log entry string lazily (```logging.info(\"blah: %s\", 4)```). This is great for improved performance if the logging library decided that the current log entry will be discarded by a log filter, so it doesn't need to format the string.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"When an expendable booster rocket stage nears the end of its burn, does the guidance computer shut the engine(s) off at a certain velocity\/altitude for the mission, or does the stage completely exhaust its propellants?","response":"First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and\/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard.

Grammatical words that don't have any meaning on their own (function words?) like have to, going to (not present continuous), has, is, was, will etc., are highly susceptible to these sound changes. For instance, have to is often pronounced hafta, trying to is pronounced tryna, want to is wanna etc etc. The same thing happened to the phrase I'm going to.\n\nThere are a few processes involved in the reduction of I'm going to to ima.\n\n* I'm going to \u2192 I'm gonna: the consonant t is often dropped in many other clusters and grammatical constructions as well (as in tryna, wanna etc). Here it's dropped and the vowel of to\u2014which is usually a schwa [\u0259]\u2014is linked with the preceding word; going to \u2192 gonna: [\u02c8\u0261\u0259\u028a\u026a\u0303\u014bt\u0259] \u2192 [\u02c8g\u0259\u0303n\u0259]\n\n* Deletion of the \/g\/: plosives (\/g t d k\/ etc) require great effort to articulate (the air is completely blocked and then released), so people dropped the plosive \/g\/ to make its articulation easier: [a\u026a\u0303m g\u0259\u0303n\u0259] \u2192 [a\u026a\u0303m \u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'm ana)\n\n* linking I'm and gonna: In causal and connected speech, consonants and vowels are often linked by a process called liaison, so both I'm and gonna join together and become [a\u026a\u0303m\u0259\u0303n\u0259] (i'mana).\n\n* Syncope of the vowel in the second syllable: Unstressed schwas are often lost through syncope (for example, 'chocolate' is choc.late for most speakers). If we removed the schwa from the second syllable, we'd get [a\u026amn\u0259] (i'mna).\n\n* Deletion of \/n\/: It's simple cluster reduction. In English, two nasals that are next to each other are often reduced to a single nasal (as in damn), so the \/n\/ is deleted, yielding in this case [a\u026a\u0303m\u0259] (i'ma). Or people dropped the \/n\/ for the sake of ease.\n\nSome people further reduce the diphthong [a\u026a] it to something like [a], which results in [a\u0303m\u0259] (ama)\nThat's why people spell it that way.

Same principle here.\nIf the boss is that much better than you and you know it, he probably knows it too. He isn't expecting any great feats of programming rock-stardom out of you. Since this is your first job, he most likely hired you because he saw the potential to become a good coder in you. So if you really want to impress him, learn. Learn the language, learn the system you're working on, learn the ins and outs and dark corners. Focus on learning correct principles, learning them well and learning them quickly, in that order.\nAnd remember that part of learning is copying knowledge that other people already have. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either of your coworkers or on StackOverflow, or research things on Google. Whatever you do, don't pretend you know something when you really don't, in an effort to avoid seeming dumb. Any good developer will notice quickly, and that will make you look even stupider in their eyes.

{"instruction":"Can I pass variables to a GNU Makefile as command line arguments? In other words, I want to pass some arguments which will eventually become variables in the Makefile.","response":"You have several options to set up variables from outside your makefile:\n\n* From environment - each environment variable is transformed into a makefile variable with the same name and value.\nYou may also want to set ```-e``` option (aka ```--environments-override```) on, and your environment variables will override assignments made into makefile (unless these assignments themselves use the ```override``` directive .  However, it's not recommended, and it's much better and flexible to use ```?=``` assignment (the conditional variable assignment operator, it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined):\n```FOO?=default_value_if_not_set_in_environment\n```\nNote that certain variables are not inherited from environment:\n\n* ```MAKE``` is gotten from name of the script\n* ```SHELL``` is either set within a makefile, or defaults to ```\/bin\/sh``` (rationale: commands are specified within the makefile, and they're shell-specific).\n\n* From command line - ```make``` can take variable assignments as part of his command line, mingled with targets:\n```make target FOO=bar\n```\nBut then all assignments to ```FOO``` variable within the makefile will be ignored unless you use the ```override``` directive in assignment. (The effect is the same as with ```-e``` option for environment variables).\n* Exporting from the parent Make - if you call Make from a Makefile, you usually shouldn't explicitly write variable assignments like this:\n```# Don't do this!\ntarget:\n        $(MAKE) -C target CC=$(CC) CFLAGS=$(CFLAGS)\n```\nInstead, better solution might be to export these variables.  Exporting a variable makes it into the environment of every shell invocation, and Make calls from these commands pick these environment variable as specified above.\n```# Do like this\nCFLAGS=-g\nexport CFLAGS\ntarget:\n        $(MAKE) -C target\n```\nYou can also export all variables by using ```export``` without arguments.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I have noticed that some games quote the requirement for \"pixel shader 3.0 or better\". \nWhat is a pixel shader and is it some software requirements or hardware requirements?","response":"Simple answer\nPixel shaders are tiny programs that can do operations on a single pixel on the screen, as opposed to geometry shaders and vertex shaders which work on the geometrical primitives (triangles) that make up everything you see on the screen. The most common use for pixel shaders is 'shading', approximation to real world lighting. Commonly used shading model is Phong.\nPixel shaders are executed on your video card, so your video card needs to support them. Each new version provides more capabilities, so an older video card will not run newer shaders. A new version of the pixel shader specification (e.g. Pixel Shader 3.0) is usually released for each new version of DirectX (more accurately, Direct3D).\nSoftware Requirements\nYou need to have the correct version of Direct3D (or OpenGL) installed in order to use the shaders. For example, Pixel Shader 4.0 requires at least Direct3D 10. Normally you don't have to worry about this, every game that uses Direct3D will install the correct version for you when you install the game. The only exceptions are Direct3D 10 and later, which will not run on Windows XP or earlier. You will need at least Windows Vista in order to play a game that uses Direct3D 10 or 11.\nWikipedia provides a nice list of Pixel Shader versions, the version of Direct3D you need, and the types of graphics cards that work with them.\n\nTechnical answer\nThe 'standard' stages of a 3D rendering pipeline are as follows (somewhat simplified):\n\n* Transformation (Moving, rotating and scaling all the objects in the scene)\n* Lighting\n* Projection ('Squashing' the 3D world into a 2D plane)\n* Clipping (Removing anything outside the field of view)\n* Rasterising (Converting the vector graphics (triangles, etc) into raster graphics (pixels))\n* Texturing\n* Display\n\nPixel Shaders are used as an alternative to the standard texturing phase. During rasterisation, each triangle is converted into pixels. These pixels do not have their final colour yet, but the do have a bunch of parameters associated with them. These include base colour, texture coordinates, lighting information, etc. The Pixel Shader is a small program that takes these parameters and uses them to calculate the final colour as it is displayed on the screen. The Pixel Shader has access to all texture data, and can use them to do interesting things such as blending two textures (to create a 'dirty' look), using a texture as a bump map (to simulate a relief), or to simulate reflections.\nHardware\nOn the hardware side, Pixel Shaders are executed on 'Shader Units', small processors on your GPU. Each Shader Unit is basically a very simple CPU, but a modern video card may contain thousands of these things (an AMD Radeon HD6990 contains over 3000). Older GPUs had different Shader Units for different tasks: Pixel Shaders were executed on different parts of the system than Vertex Shaders. Modern GPUs have so called 'unified shader units' which can perform all of these operations.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Pixel shaders are

{"instruction":"Red light facing forwards? It was nighttime in Manhattan. Isn't more always better when it comes to being seen?","response":"No. You should always ride with a white light facing forward and a red light facing backwards. If you want additional illumination, you can add multiple white\/red lights in the appropriate direction. Amber\/yellow lights can be used facing any direction for additional visibility. \nThe first reason is that it's the law:\n\n  (a) Every bicycle when in use during the period from one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise shall be equipped with a lamp on the front which shall emit a white light visible during hours of darkness from a distance of at least five hundred feet to the front and with a red or amber light visible to the rear for three hundred feet. Effective July first, nineteen hundred seventy-six, at least one of these lights shall be visible for two hundred feet from each side.\n\nMore importantly for your safety though, the color of a light conveys a certain meaning. Drivers, pedestrians, and other cyclists associate the color red with a taillight and the color white with a headlight. If you put the wrong color facing the wrong direction, people may think you are traveling the opposite direction. Imagine a car is pulling out of a driveway and sees a red bike light flashing to their left. They may assume that means a bike is moving away from them on the left. If they then pull out of the driveway and you're really moving towards them, you could get hit. ","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do.

{"instruction":"Can Romex (NM-B) cable be run through conduit?","response":"Yes, NM (Romex) cable can be in conduit. In fact, National Electrical Code (NEC() calls for it to be in conduit, when protection from physical damage is required. But it really isn't worth it.\n\n## It's a nightmare to pull\nNM (Romex) is already solid wire except in the large sizes, and now you have 3-4 wires bound together. You are trying to pull this around maybe 14\" radius elbows, and if the NM gets twists in it (it always does), it really drags in those places. It's just a stiff, miserable pull - enough to \"put you off conduit forever\" - which is a shame, because conduit is wonderful when using easy-to-pull stranded wire.\n\nPulling this stiff cable increases the risk of damaging the cable. What's more, \"cable in conduit\" is often a newbie who chooses cable simply because he is unaware that wire comes in any other forms. Which leads to more risk of damage still.\n\n## It requires ridiculously large conduit\nYou still have to calculate and respect conduit fill rules, and those are very punishing toward cable. Most cable is oblong, and the rules say you use the largest dimension and treat it as a circular wire of that dimension.\n\n* For a single \"wire\", you are allowed 53% conduit fill. That means the conduit ID must be at least 137% of the large cross-section of the cable. That's not so bad, but...\n* For two \"wires\", you're only allowed 31% fill. That's to protect the wires from binding. That means the conduit ID must be at least 2.54 times the cable large dimension.\n* For three \"wires\", you're allowed 40% fill.

The lambda is ```move```d into the ```std::function```, so any movable state is efficiently carried into it.\nIn the second case, a temporary ```std::function``` is created, the lambda is ```move```d into it, then that temporary ```std::function``` is used by reference within the ```run_in_ui_thread```.\nSo far, so good -- the two of them perform identically.

If there is any possibility you are storing a copy of the ```std::function```, pass by value.  Otherwise, either way is roughly equivalent: the only downside to by-value is if you are taking the same bulky ```std::function``` and having one sub method after another use it.

{"instruction":"What are some of the advantages of using one over the other?","response":"ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC are two web frameworks developed by Microsoft - they are both good choices.  Neither of the web frameworks are to be replaced by the other nor are there plans to have them 'merged' into a single framework.  Continued support and development are done in parallel by Microsoft and neither will be 'going away'.\nEach of these web frameworks offers advantages\/disadvantages - some of which need to be considered when developing a web application.  A web application can be developed using either technology - it might make development for a particular application easier selecting one technology versus the other and vice versa.\nASP.NET Web Forms:\n\n* Development supports state\n\u2022   Gives the illusion that a web application is aware of what the user has been doing, similar to Windows applications.  I.e. Makes 'wizard' functionality a little bit easier to implement.  Web forms does a great job at hiding a lot of that complexity from the developer.\n* Rapid Application Development (RAD)\n\u2022   The ability to just 'jump in' and start delivering web forms.  This is disputed by some of the MVC community, but pushed by Microsoft.  In the end, it comes down to the level of expertise of the developer and what they are comfortable with.  The web forms model probably has less of a learning curve to less experienced developers.\n* Larger control toolbox\n\u2022   ASP.NET Web Forms offers a much greater and more robust toolbox (web controls) whereas MVC offers a more primitive control set relying more on rich client-side controls via jQuery (Javascript).\n* Mature\n\u2022   It's been around since 2002 and there is an abundance of information with regards to questions, problems, etc.  Offers more third-party control - need to consider your existing toolkits.\n\nASP.NET MVC:\n\n* Separation of concerns (SoC)\n\u2022   From a technical standpoint, the organization of code within MVC is very clean, organized and granular, making it easier (hopefully) for a web application to scale in terms of functionality.  Promotes great design from a development standpoint.\n* Easier integration with client side tools (rich user interface tools)\n\u2022   More than ever, web applications are increasingly becoming as rich as the applications you see on your desktops.  With MVC, it gives you the ability to integrate with such toolkits (such as jQuery) with greater ease and more seamless than in Web Forms.\n* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly \/ Stateless\n\u2022   URL's are more friendly to search engines (i.e.  mywebapplication.com\/users\/ 1 - retrieve user with an ID of 1 vs mywebapplication\/users\/getuser.aspx (id passed in session)).  Similarly, since MVC is stateless, this removes the headache of users who spawn multiple web browsers from the same window (session collisions).  Along those same lines, MVC adheres to the stateless web protocol rather than 'battling' against it.\n* Works well with developers who need high degree of control\n\u2022   Many controls in ASP.NET web forms automatically generate much of the raw HTML you see when an page is rendered.  This can cause headaches for developers.  With MVC, it lends itself better towards having complete control with what is rendered and there are no surprises.  Even more important, is that the HTML forms typically are much smaller than the Web forms which can equate to a performance boost - something to seriously consider.\n* Test Driven Development (TDD)\n\u2022   With MVC, you can more easily  create tests for the web side of things.  An additional layer of testing will provide yet another layer of defense against unexpected behavior.\n\nAuthentication, authorization, configuration, compilation and deployment are all features that are shared between the two web frameworks.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What factors determine the maximum altitude for a plane?\nIs it limited by wing design, engine thrust, and so on?\nIs there a formula by which one can calculate the maximum altitude a plane can reach?","response":"The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet \/ turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

The outcome will be something quite unexpected:\n```    2 \/ \"blah\"  \/\/ will be treated as  2 \/ 1500275048\n```\nSince JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being Typed, it must be.

To hold the result of the last executed expression in an interactive interpreter session (see docs). This precedent was set by the standard CPython interpreter, and other interpreters have followed suit.\n\n2. For translation lookup in i18n (see the gettext documentation for example), as in code like\n```raise forms.ValidationError(_(&quot;Please enter a correct username&quot;))\n```\n\n3. As a general purpose &quot;throwaway&quot; variable name:\n\n* To indicate that part of a function result is being deliberately ignored (Conceptually, it is being discarded.), as in code like:\n```label, has_label, _ = text.partition(':')\n```\n\n* As part of a function definition (using either ```def``` or ```lambda```), where the signature is fixed (e.g. by a callback or parent class API), but this particular function implementation doesn't need all of the parameters, as in code like:\n```def callback(_):\n    return True\n```\n\nThis use case can conflict with the translation lookup use case, so it is necessary to avoid using ```_``` as a throwaway variable in any code block that also uses it for i18n translation (many folks prefer a double-underscore, ```__```, as their throwaway variable for exactly this reason).\n\nLinters often recognize this use case. For example ```year, month, day = date()``` will raise a lint warning if ```day``` is not used later in the code. The fix, if ```day``` is truly not needed, is to write ```year, month, _ = date()```. Same with lambda functions, ```lambda arg: 1.0``` creates a function requiring one argument but not using it, which will be caught by lint. The fix is to write ```lambda _: 1.0```. An unused variable is often hiding a bug\/typo (e.g. set ```day``` but use ```dya``` in the next line).\n\nThe pattern matching feature added in Python 3.10 elevated this usage from &quot;convention&quot; to &quot;language syntax&quot; where ```match``` statements are concerned: in match cases, ```_``` is a wildcard pattern, and the runtime doesn't even bind a value to the symbol in that case.\n\nFor other use cases, remember that ```_``` is still a valid variable name, and hence will still keep objects alive. In cases where this is undesirable (e.g. to release memory or external resources) an explicit ```del name``` call will both satisfy linters that the name is being used, and promptly clear the reference to the object.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

This is how normal ```malloc``` gets more pages from the OS as well; ```calloc``` just takes advantage of the OS's guarantee.\nThis means ```calloc``` memory can still be &quot;clean&quot; and lazily-allocated, and copy-on-write mapped to a system-wide shared physical page of zeros.  (Assuming a system with virtual memory.)  The effects are visible with performance experiments on Linux, for example.\nSome compilers even can optimize malloc + memset(0) into calloc for you, but it's best to just use calloc in the source if you want zeroed memory.  (Or if you were trying to pre-fault it to avoid page faults later, that optimization will defeat your attempt.)\nIf you aren't going to ever read memory before writing it, use ```malloc``` so it can (potentially) give you dirty memory from its internal free list instead of getting new pages from the OS.  (Or instead of zeroing a block of memory on the free list for a small allocation).\n\nEmbedded implementations of ```calloc``` may leave it up to ```calloc``` itself to zero memory if there's no OS, or it's not a fancy multi-user OS that zeros pages to stop information leaks between processes.\nOn embedded Linux, malloc could ```mmap(MAP_UNINITIALIZED|MAP_ANONYMOUS)```, which is only enabled for some embedded kernels because it's insecure on a multi-user system.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

I base my opinion on coroutines on this design talk by Andrey Breslav (JetBrains) Slideshow from the talk is accessible here.","response":"Kotlin coroutines are different from Rx. It is hard to compare them apples-to-apples, because Kotlin coroutines are a thin language feature (with just a couple of basic concepts and a few basic functions to manipulate them), while Rx is a pretty heavy library with quite large variety of ready-to-use operators. Both are designed to address a problem of asynchronous programming, however their approach to solution is very different:\n\n* Rx comes with a particular functional style of programming that can be implemented in virtually any programming language without support from the language itself. It works well when the problem at hand easily decomposes into a sequence of standard operators and not so well otherwise.\n* Kotlin coroutines provide a language feature that let library writers implement various asynchronous programming styles, including, but not limited to functional reactive style (Rx). With Kotlin coroutines you can also write your asynchronous code in imperative style, in promise\/futures-based style, in actor-style, etc. \n\nIt is more appropriate to compare Rx with some specific libraries that are implemented based on Kotlin coroutines. \nTake kotlinx.coroutines library as one example. This library provides a set of primitives like ```async\/await``` and channels that are typically baked into other programming languages. It also has support for light-weight future-less actors. You can read more in the Guide to kotlinx.coroutines by example.\nChannels provided by ```kotlinx.coroutines``` can replace or augment Rx in certain use-cases.

Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Parkes says:\n\n  Breath\u2010holding is a voluntary act, but normal subjects appear unable\n  to breath\u2010hold to unconsciousness. A powerful involuntary mechanism\n  normally overrides voluntary breath\u2010holding and causes the breath that\n  defines the breakpoint.\n\nParkes explains that voluntary breath\u2010holding does not stop the central respiratory rhythm. Instead, breath holding merely suppresses its expression by voluntarily holding the chest at a certain volume. At the time of writing, no simple explanation for the break point existed. It is known to be caused by partial pressures of blood gases activating the carotid arterial chemoreceptors. They are peripheral sensory neurons that detect changes in chemical concentrations, including low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). Both hypoxia and hypercapnia are signs of breath holding and both are detected by the chemoreceptors. These receptors send nerve signals to the vasomotor center of the medulla which eventually overrides the conscious breath holding.\n\nThe breaking point can be postponed by large lung inflations, hyperoxia and hypocapnia, and it is shortened by increased metabolic rates.\n\nReference\n- Parkes, Exp Physiol (2006); 91(1): 1-15","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why can't MX records point to an IP address?","response":"The whole idea behind the mail exchange (MX) record is to specify a host or hosts which can accept mail for a domain. As specified in RFC 1035, the MX record contains a domain name. It must therefore point to a host which itself can be resolved in the DNS. An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP\/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol. A single MX record can't possibly list more than one address, so the only option is to point to a host, where all of that host's addresses can then be looked up. (As a performance optimization, the DNS server will send along the address records for the host in the response additional section if it has authoritative records for them, saving a round trip.)\n\nThere is also the situation that arises when your mail exchangers are provided by a third party (e.g. Google Apps or Office 365). You point your MX records to their hostnames, but it may occur that the service provider needs to change the mail servers' IP addresses. Since you have pointed to a host, the service provider can do this transparently and you don't have to make any changes to your records.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money and save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out. An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. \n\nAs far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports other than the fact that ATC is much busier.

Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan).

Depending on how many days are in the month, some months it will run on odd days and some on even. This is because the way it is calculated takes the total number of possibilities and divides them up. You can override this strage-ish behavior by manually specifying the day range and using either an odd or even number of days. Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31\/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30\/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month. Likewise if you are forcing an even cycle, each leap year will cause one three-day cycle at the end of February. You cannot really get around the fact that any regular pattern of \"every other day\" is not always going to fall on even or odd days in every month and any way you force this you will either have an extra run or be missing a run between months with mismatched day counts.","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Are there studies or expert opinions on one approach being preferable to the other at different stages of language learning?

In most cases, strategies are not mutually exclusive but complementary. \n\nWith vocabulary learning, using just one strategy is probably the least efficient. This is because every strategy has certain strengths (certain skills it builds well) and certain weaknesses (skills it doesn't cover well)- and if you keep using one strategy, you'll be only focusing on the strengths (but with diminishing returns), and not addressing the weaknesses.\n\nUsing flashcards helps you establish word-to-meaning equivalences quickly, but it usually does so with a shallow meaning, ignoring the breadth of meaning that words usually have. It also ignores the contextual subtleties of the word, and the knowledge is not always retained long-term. \n\nIt's best to combine flashcards with other strategies that will help you see how the word is used in context, show you the variety of meanings it can have (and doesn't have), see what collocations the word has, etc. One way of doing this is by reading examples of the word and writing your own sample sentences. Another important thing is to be exposed to the word in natural settings - so it's important to read a lot so that you'll encounter the words you've learnt naturally.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20\u00b0C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.","response":"Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why is the volt not identical to the full name Volta, unlike the other electrical units ohm, ampere, coulomb, tesla, weber and henry? Is there a historical explanation, was the volt introduced at a different time?","response":"The volt, ohm and farad were introduced by the same person, Latimer Clark, a cable engineer, in a paper in 1861. He started the tradition of naming units after scientists. He initially distorted all names: the unit names ohma, volt, galvat (from Galvani), and farad (from Faraday). In his words, he \"neglected etymological rules\". \n\nIn that same year, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science began developing a coherent system of electrical units, the cgs system. Varley, a committee member, liked Clark's proposal, but he advocated adding a French name such as Ampere, to facilitate the international acceptance of the new units (\"I should like to introduce a French name into the list. We have Germany, England and Italy represented\"). For the same reason he may have pleaded for not distorting the French and German names. In addition, Varley objected to the galvat \"because Galvani discovered next to nothing\".\n\nLatimer Clark adapted the unit names in his 'Elementary treatise on electrical measurement' (1868). He changed ohma to ohm, and dropped the galvat. Maxwell acknowledged Clark's practical units and their names in his 'Treatise on electricity and magnetism' (1873). In 1881, at the International Electrical Congress in Paris), two French names, ampere and coulomb, were added. The diplomacy worked, and the new system of electrical units was adopted by all countries. The only units that kept the initial name distortion were the volt and the farad.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Why does that force have to be a cross product of two vectors?\nIs it possible to come up with them when what we do is just observe the nature?","response":"This is a great question. The dot and cross products seem very mysterious when they are first introduced to a new student. For example, why does the scalar (dot) product have a cosine in it and the vector (cross) product have a sine, rather than vice versa? And why do these same two very non-obvious ways of \"multiplying\" vectors together arise in so many different contexts?\n\nThe fundamental answer (which unfortunately may not be very accessible if you're a new student) is that there are only two algebraically independent tensors that are invariant under arbitrary rotations in $n$ dimensions (we say that they are \"$\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ invariant\"). These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$. Contracting two vectors with these symbols yields the dot and cross products, respectively (the latter only works in three dimensions). Since the laws of physics appear to be isotropic (i.e. rotationally invariant), it makes sense that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic as well. The dot and cross products turn out to be the only two possible multilinear options.\n\nWhy multilinear maps are so useful in physics is an even deeper and more fundamental question, but which answers to that question are satisfying is probably inherently a matter of opinion.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why is it hard to draw people running in animes?","response":"The walk cycle is considered to be one of the most basic aspects of animation. American animators and animation enthusiasts often times scorn the Japanese styles and methods of animation as lazy, while Japanese anime enthusiasts deride the American style as clunky or too comical.\n\nWhy is that you ask? The answer lies in how these countries distribute their budget and time. \n\nWhile American animation often times may seem lacking in it's attention to detail, it makes up for it the quality of their animation. American animation often times meticulous and original in how they animate motion, though sometimes content is reused cyclically, the animation is painstakingly frame by frame. \n\nIn contrast, Japanese anime uses a lot of shortcuts (to save budget and meet deadlines). Typically long scenes feature only the mouth of a character (and maybe other minor features like a waving hair or glittering eyes) moving during delivery of key information\/dialog, or the short burst of motion of some character in some an action pose against an animated, cyclic, and stylized background (I'm looking at you transformation scenes). Often times these uses of dramatic still-shots are done against patterned (or static illustrated) backgrounds, sometimes a few moving emotive icons (sweat drops, question marks, small chibi animated heads) will accompany a some sort of monologue. Admittedly both styles of animation reuse shots and sequences, but it's more noticeable in Japanese anime for various reason (e.g., not enough budget and\/or manpower). This is why Japanese anime is typically labeled as \"lazy\" by American animators and enthusiasts.\n\nA typical walk cycle in animation consists of 8 keyframes typically:\n\nThe smoothness of an animation is typically determined by the framerate and amount of key frames in the animation. \nIn American animation, the animation is captured by shooting two frames of film per drawing at a rate of 24 frames per second (fps) to achieve the smooth motion of American animation. \nJapanese anime, while it also runs at an average 24 fps, typically captures their animation at a rate of three or four frames per drawing in order to save money and manpower. Though it varies depending on the studio and tools used (e.g 3DCG) with main objects in the foreground (typically characters) are animated at 8 to 12 fps, while background objects can be animated at as low as 6 to 8 fps.\n\nLets compare the difference between one walk cycle that is 8 frame to one that is 16 frames, both at 60 fps:\n  \nNotice the 16 frame one is smoother, but slower while the 8 frame is faster, but choppier. This is because it takes the 16 frame animation twice as long, covering more frames, to go through one cycle than the 8 frame one.\nThe varying of frame rates can also be be used to depict the expansion and compression of time (think bullet time from The Matrix). However generally choppy animation is the result of not enough keyframes in your animation. More frames mean more and manpower and\/or time, which ultimately means more money is required. Japanese anime production don't typically have as big of a budget compared to American productions (but there are exceptions), so they must make do with what they have and cut corners where they can (like Shaft did with the certain Bakemonogatari TV episodes).","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

In English, we speak of the Holy Roman Empire; in German, it is the HRR or \"Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation\". \n\nWiktionary quotes Busching, who in 1762 explained Reich as a German understanding of \"Eminence\", from the Latin Regnum, rather than an Empire or a Realm as other cultures would understand it. \n\nOne could see it as a word used in English, Russian, Portuguese and many other languages as a designation for any kind of German kingdom, empire or absolutism, similar to how one would address a foreigner according to their origin, e.g. Senor Martinez, Monsieur Aragon.\n\nCompare it to how many cultures, including the Germans, also use the word \"Commonwealth\" or \"Soviet Union\", despite the fact that Bavaria had formed its own Union of Soviets, the R\u00e4terepublik, during the Weimar Republic.\n\nIf you're interested in knowing when the word \"Third Reich\" came into usage, it is worth noting that during Fascist Germany, the country's official name was Das Deutsche Reich, and in the USA and UK it was usually referred to as Germany, Hitler's Germany, Berlin, Reich or, the most popular term, Nazi Germany. \n\n(Sources: Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war against Germany, headlines about Germany in newspapers like the NY Times or the Times, the Daily Mail's Lord Rothermere)\n\nIn Germany itself, the idea of a third Reich stemmed from the 19th century, where it was a popular philosophical theme in literature and theology. Writers like Johannes Schlaf, who wrote \"Das Dritte Reich\" in 1899, or the German translator of Ibsen's \"The Emperor and the Galilean\", popularized the idea of the imminent arrival of a thousand years of Christianity (a kind of positive apocalypse), which would follow a third \"Reich\". And they would quote Paul the Apostle and various saints, to make it clear that the third Reich would follow the heretic lex naturalis and the lex mosaica. \n\nNazi propagandists exploited this in their articles, making it sound as if the saints had had some sort of epiphany about Hitler and the Nazis.\n\nIn other words, the Third Reich began as an abstract idea of a Christian revolution, but was assumed by Nazi writers in order to bolster Hitler's popularity and justify the drastic and bloody decisions that the Fascist government was making.\n\nIn one of the earliest examples of the Third Reich being mentioned outside of Germany, Major Strasser in the film Casablanca talks about the Third Reich as if it was just the beginning to a kind of paradisaical future or of a fourth Reich.\n\nAfter 1945, the term was used exclusively to associate only to the unsuccessful reign of Fascism in Germany, and it ceased as a philosophical or theological idea in German literary circles.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"If we fold a paper and then apply pressure on the newly formed crease, it seems that the paper's surface gets a permanent deformation but what exactly has happened to the paper at a molecular scale?","response":"Basically, a fold or crease in paper will remain because the structure of the fibers in the paper have become irreversibly damaged. This happens because the paper is bent\/compressed beyond its elastic limit.\n\nChemically, paper is mainly composed of cellulose  from plant fibers. Cellulose is an organic polymer, which has D-glucose units connected through hydrogen bonds. These bonds form between the oxygen atom of the one-hydroxyl group belonging to the glucose and the hydrogen atom of the next glucose unit. These are microscopic properties of paper, but to understand what happens when we fold paper or do Origami, it is sufficient to learn what is happening macroscopically.\n\nAll materials have what is called an elastic limit and a plastic region. The elastic limit is the point at which a material will bend but still return to its original position without any permanent change or damage to its structure. Further deforming the material beyond this limit takes it to its plastic region. At this point any structural or physical changes become permanent and the paper will not return to its original form.\n\nEvery material has a different elastic limit or yield, and plastic region. Imagine holding a piece of paper slightly bent but not folding or creasing it. The plant fibers that make up the paper will not have exceeded their elastic limit. So as soon as you let go of the paper sheet it will quickly return to its noncreased original flat state. However, if you were to roll that piece of paper into a cylinder and hold it for a few minutes, some of these fibers will be pushed beyond the elastic limit which is evident since it will not lie flat anymore since slight deformations have occurred in this sheet.\n\nNow, when you properly fold a piece of paper as you would during Origami, the plant fibers along the crease are pushed into the plastic region of the paper, causing a fracture point at the actual line of the fold. A practical example of this is if you were to fold a piece of paper, you will note that if you stretch the paper evenly on both sides of the fold, the paper will tear right on the fold (a quick way to &quot;cut&quot; paper if you have no scissors). The fold then becomes an irreversible structural failure and the fibers in the paper will never regain their original state.\n\nBecause of this damage to its structure, the paper will from then on have this fold. And no matter how hard you try to flatten out the fold it will never return to its original state. This is why Origami models continually retain their shape.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"In general, there are two types of syntax of defining functions - Something like C, C++, C#, or Java (```int functionName(char arg)```) vs the ML (and others) tradition of defining the return type after the function (and using something like a ```fun``` keyword to define a function - like ```fun functionName(char arg): int```).\nOne of the advantages (for the parser, at least) for a ```fun``` keyword is that it lets the parser be context-free (it doesn't have to guess if ```int``` defines a variable or if it defines a function).\nWhen C was invented, computers had very little memory and speed (so little, that the reason C requires one to define all the variables in the beginning of the function was because it had to be a one-pass parser). Why didn't they choose the simple way out and use function defining keyword?","response":"Dennis Ritchie\u2019s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can\u2019t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn\u2019t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren\u2019t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didn\u2019t deal with types inside argument lists.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I am new to TeX, working on it for about 2 months. Have not yet figured out how to script the 'curvy L' for Lagrangian and\/or for Laplace Transforms.\nAs of now I am using the 'L' - which is not good! :-( \nAny help?\nUPDATE The 2 best solutions are;\n```\\usepackage{ amssymb }\n\\mathcal{L}\n```\nand\n```\\usepackage{ mathrsfs }\n\\mathscr{L}\n```\nI got my answers at, http:\/\/detexify.kirelabs.org\/classify.html ","response":"You have been told how to get a curved L. But here's some more general advice, which also applies in this situation: In cases such as this, always create your own shortcut macro, say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nThis way, if you ever decide that that curly L is not quite the one you like, it is easy to switch. Also, even before you knew the answer to this question, you could have written\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{L}\n```\nin your preamble. Then you could start\/continue writing the document, use ordinary capital Ls where you want, and ```\\Lagr``` wherever you actually mean a Lagrangian, and then later changing the definition of ```\\Lagr``` to something appropriate. This way, you wouldn't have to manually search for each occurence of a capital L and decide if it's a Lagrangian or not. Clearly ```\\Lagr``` (or whatever you want to call this macro) is also easier to type than ```\\mathcal{L}```, and it makes the source code much more readable.\n\nAnother advantage, which is probably more subtle, since you're new to LaTeX, is that we can make the curvy L exactly the type of math we want. TeX distinguishes between ordinary letters, binary operators, binary relations, opening and closing parenthesis and so on; the spacing between two ordinary letters is not the same as the spacing between the ```a```, ```+```, and ```b``` in ```$a+b$```. So since the Lagrangian is a kind of operator, we could say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathop{\\mathcal{L}}}\n```\n\nBut in the case of operators, the package amsmath (which you are most likely using; if not, you should) provides a somewhat better mechanism:\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nAnother (related) tip: Even if you are using the same notation for two different things, it is best to make a separate macro for each. In this case you might have\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lapl}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\nThe reason is the same as in the ```L``` vs. ```\\Lagr``` case above: If you at some point decide that using ```\\mathcal{L}``` for both is a bad idea, you would have to find each occurence of ```\\Lagr``` and figure out if it is really a Laplacian. Using macro names carrying semantic meaning is one of the great powers of TeX.","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"What are the differences between the Strategy design pattern and the State design pattern? please explain the difference in layman's terms?","response":"The difference simply lies in that they solve different problems:  \n\n* The State pattern deals with what (state or type) an object is (in) -- it encapsulates state-dependent behavior, whereas  \n* the Strategy pattern deals with how an object performs a certain task -- it encapsulates an algorithm.  \n\nThe constructs for achieving these different goals are however very similar; both patterns are examples of composition with delegation.\n\nSome observations on their advantages:\n* By using the State pattern the state-holding (context) class is relieved from knowledge of what state or type it is and what states or types that are available. This means that the class adheres to the open-closed design principle (OCP): the class is closed for changes in what states\/types there are, but the states\/types are open to extensions.\n* By using the Strategy pattern the algorithm-using (context) class is relieved from knowledge of how to perform a certain task (-- the \"algorithm\"). This case also creates an adherence to the OCP; the class is closed for changes regarding how to perform this task, but the design is very open to additions of other algorithms for solving this task.\n\nThis likely also improves the context class' adherence to the single responsibility principle (SRP). Further the algorithm becomes easily available for reuse by other classes.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why don't Tour de France riders always ride their TT bikes?","response":"There are 2 good reasons for this. \n\nFirst, a TT bike is the most efficient machine for flat, fast course racing, where there are a minimum of hills. It is not the most efficient machine when it comes to climbing. The body position is far too aggressive for even professional athletes to use in a non-TT style event. A bike with more a more upright body position, a more stable weight distribution, a lighter frame, and far, far lighter wheels, is a more efficient choice for that style of ride.\n\nSecondly, a TT bike sacrifices bike handling for that extreme power and aero efficiency. The TT stages are controlled events, where there are either one rider, or one team on the course at a time, and so limitations on stability and handling are acceptable. Take the same bike in a 150 rider peloton, where riders constantly jockey for position, and where even on a stable bike losing focus for 1 second can cause a major crash, and all of a sudden, those same sacrifices in bike handling and stability are no longer a benefit for the rider or the team. They become a hazard to the team's chances of winning. And not just for the stage or the day, since a bad crash can take a rider out for the season. \n\nOr God forbid, permanently. \nFor these reasons, the UCI has seen fit to ban the bikes in non-TT events, in order to ensure rider safety.

{"instruction":"I understand that unlocking the bootloader will wipe my Android phone, but have been looking around for why.  Seems to be by design, but what is the reasoning for that design?  Is it some security concern, some obscure technical reason, or just for lulz?  I'm looking for something solid to chew on here, something more than because \"that's how it is\".","response":"It's a security concern. The Android documentation doesn't provide a lot of elaboration, stating simply:\n\n  The procedure must be confirmed on-screen, and deletes the user data for privacy reasons.\n\nHowever, the privacy concern is relatively straightforward to extrapolate. Once the bootloader is unlocked, the device can be flashed with unsigned images. This means that it is relatively trivial to root the device, and there are actually multiple ways it can be done, such as:\n\n* Flashing a system image with root tools built in\n* Flashing a boot image that runs ```adbd``` with root by default (an \"unsecure\" image)\n* Flashing a recovery image, then using that to overwrite the system or boot partitions with ones that allow root access\n\nOnce root is obtained, all of the information on ```\/data``` essentially becomes accessible. This could be emails, contact information, or many other pieces of personal information that you likely don't want in the wrong hands. \n\nTherefore, it makes sense to wipe all of this data during the unlocking procedure to ensure that there is no off-the-shelf \"official\" way of bypassing the sandboxing restrictions implemented by the Android operating system, which would thereby allow someone to steal personal data.\n\nOf course, there may be ways to root without wiping on some devices, but they rely on exploits rather than official methods like a bootloader unlock, meaning they are basically bugs.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"The original IBM PC and later variants used an Intel 8253 or 8254 as a sound chip. Why did users add sound cards such as the Adlib or Sound Blaster. I remember voice output with programs like telephone answering programs. The sound was wimpy but I attributed most of the quality to speaker size.\nWhat was lacking with the original PC sound chip? ","response":"> The original IBM PC and later variants used an Intel 8253 or 8254 as a sound chip.\n\nThe 8253 is a timer circuit, containing three timers able to generate timed interrupts or square-wave output with programmed frequencies. On the PC the third timer's output is, via an amplifier, connected to a simple speaker.\n\nAs said before, calling a 'simple' timer a sound chip is quite a stretch. \nSince it's a digital output, no level control is available. Only on or off is possible. At best this results in rather nasty sounding square waves. There is no provision to smooth the signal (beside the inertia of the speaker membrane).\n\nAlso, the only frequencies that can be selected are those that result from dividing the base frequency (1,193,181.8 Hz) by an integer in the range of 1&ndash;65535. So even when accepting the meager signal quality, only very few notes can be played at correct frequency. Already the basic 440 Hz concert pitch will be off by .5Hz. So whatever is played using the timer will sound off pitch. Music can still sound good if a little off pitch, but only when all notes are off in the same way (*1) - which is not the case with this 'sound chip'.\n\nOf course, there are also ways to manipulate the sound even a bit better by manually handling the output - which results in 100% CPU time usage.\n\n> Why did users add sound cards such as the Adlib or Sound Blaster.\n\nSimply because they wanted sound - or at least music. Not just a beeper.\n\n> What was lacking with the original PC sound chip?\n\nAs said before, it's no sound chip at all. A sound chip will need programmable oscillators for different wave forms and at least some analogue ciruitry to make a smooth, more natural sound. Ofcourse, from an enginering point, the PC's use of a timer was a great improvement over the Apple II, its model and competition, as it allowed the beeping in parallel - not that this feature was used by BIOS or DOS.\nLast but not least, the PC is an open system. It is made to add new\/better hardware. So why shoudn't there be a real sound card? Improving the machine is a core feature of the design.\n\nAddendum:\nagtoever added a comment with a great example of what was possible with the direct fiddling with the speaker. Awesome, but less than apealing when compared to even the cheapest form of soundcard, the AdLib of the same time, as used by Monkey Island. Next to zero CPU usage and crisp clear sound. Not to mention easy programming. I'd call that a huge advantage.\n\n*1 - The average human decodes frequencies relative to each other. As a result sound is still perceived as good, even if the whole scale is shifted, as long as it's in the same direction and same percentage. Output needs to be way off to be noticed by an average listener. In contrast, if notes are off by a different margin and in different directions, even less trained listeners will notice.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"According to the sources I have found, a lambda expression is essentially implemented by the compiler creating a class with overloaded function call operator and the referenced variables as members. This suggests that the size of lambda expressions varies, and given enough references variables that size can be arbitrarily large.\nAn ```std::function``` should have a fixed size, but it must be able to wrap any kind of callables, including any lambdas of the same kind. How is it implemented? If ```std::function``` internally uses a pointer to its target, then what happens, when the ```std::function``` instance is copied or moved? Are there any heap allocations involved?","response":"The implementation of ```std::function``` can differ from one implementation to another, but the core idea is that it uses type-erasure. While there are multiple ways of doing it, you can imagine a trivial (not optimal) solution could be like this (simplified for the specific case of ```std::function<int (double)>``` for the sake of simplicity):\n```struct callable_base {\n   virtual int operator()(double d) = 0;\n   virtual ~callable_base() {}\n};\ntemplate <typename F>\nstruct callable : callable_base {\n   F functor;\n   callable(F functor) : functor(functor) {}\n   virtual int operator()(double d) { return functor(d); }\n};\nclass function_int_double {\n   std::unique_ptr<callable_base> c;\npublic:\n   template <typename F>\n   function(F f) {\n      c.reset(new callable<F>(f));\n   }\n   int operator()(double d) { return c(d); }\n\/\/ ...\n};\n```\nIn this simple approach the ```function``` object would store just a ```unique_ptr``` to a base type. For each different functor used with the ```function```, a new type derived from the base is created and an object of that type instantiated dynamically. The ```std::function``` object is always of the same size and will allocate space as needed for the different functors in the heap.\nIn real life there are different optimizations that provide performance advantages but would complicate the answer. The type could use small object optimizations, the dynamic dispatch can be replaced by a free-function pointer that takes the functor as argument to avoid one level of indirection, but the idea is basically the same.\n\nRegarding the issue of how copies of the ```std::function``` behave, a quick test indicates that copies of the internal callable object are done, rather than sharing the state.\n```\/\/ g++4.8\nint main() {\n   int value = 5;\n   typedef std::function<void()> fun;\n   fun f1 = [=]() mutable { std::cout << value++ << '\\n' };\n   fun f2 = f1;\n   f1();                    \/\/ prints 5\n   fun f3 = f1;\n   f2();                    \/\/ prints 5\n   f3();                    \/\/ prints 6 (copy after first increment)\n}\n```\nThe test indicates that ```f2``` gets a copy of the callable entity, rather than a reference. If the callable entity was shared by the different ```std::function<>``` objects, the output of the program would have been 5, 6, 7.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"So, I'm on vacation in Utah, and so I attended an LDS service. In the morning, I heard a reading from one of the Presidents of the church during the \"Quorum of the Elders,\" then went to Sunday School, and finally witnessed the Sacrement of the bread and water. (I guess it makes sense there was no wine, but it did make me go \"Huh!\") After that, there were testimonies from missionaries and some music - but nothing that struck me as a sermon. \nWas I missing something, or was this an atypical service? I guess I was trying to understand what the \"pastor\"s role in the service was supposed to be - or again, is it just that Mormons are even more Baptist than baptists?\nIf someone could explain how instruction and exhortation are primarily conferred in the LDS church Id appreciate it. ","response":"Mormon services are a bit different, as you discovered. In the United States, there is generally a block of 3 meetings back-to-back including a sunday school, a mens' and women's time for instruction, and a sacrament meeting where the general congregation meets together. It sounds like the first meeting you attended was Priesthood meeting where the brothers study the words of scripture and modern Church leaders. Those classes usually have a single instructor each week.\n\nSacrament meeting is where any equivalence of a sermon would be heard. The primary difference between Mormon services and some others is the focal event of church meetings. The purpose behind holding a sacrament meeting is to take the sacrament and renew covenants made at baptism. The actual administration of the sacrament is the most sacred public meeting to Mormons. Hearing people speak and even interpersonal communion (socializing) is only secondary, though important.\n\nMembers of a ward, or local congregation, are invited to speak by the bishop or his counselors (the basic equivalent of a pastor) and will have some time to prepare a talk. Talks should draw from the scriptures, personal experience and testimony, and focus on the Savior. Note that comments made by church members over the pulpit at a sacrament meeting do not necessarily reflect the Church's official position on a topic or even Church doctrine.\nThe talks are meant to urge, inspire, and exhort all in attendance to come to Christ, to give them an opportunity to feel the power of the Spirit, and to strengthen their faith. Often, members will come with questions in their hearts and find answers in the words that day.\n\nCounsel from leaders like a bishop sometimes occur over the pulpit, but usually this is private and individual, based on personal circumstances. The bishop and his counselors are supposed to meet with members regularly in interviews. There is no paid clergy, so all the service is volunteer.\n\nEach member is also assigned two \"home teachers\" which visit their family once a month to share a gospel message, check on well-being, and be a friend and support especially when needed. In this way, instruction is given which might also help replace a typical sermon pattern. The bishop, his counselors, and others he calls on help organize these efforts. (It has also proven to be very quick and effective during disaster response, as home teachers immediately report in on who they teach, and bishops coordinate an effort if needed.\n\nSo what you saw was apparently quite normal. Even once a month (the first Sunday), a fast and testimony meeting is held during sacrament meeting, where members forgo preparing talks and instead bear their testimonies about Christ and the gospel for the hour as they feel a desire to do so. Instruction is very member-to-member, you might say, but is guided by the direction of a bishop and other church leaders who also inspire and instruct.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovi\u010d for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

Use regular expressions.\nFrom Oracle 10g onwards `REGEXP_LIKE()` is available.

Change it at the session level.\nThe NLS_SORT parameter governs the collation sequence for ordering and the various comparison operators, including `=` and LIKE. You can specify a binary, case-insensitive, sort by altering the session. This will mean that every query performed in that session will perform case-insensitive parameters.\n```\nalter session set nls_sort=BINARY_CI\n```\nThere's plenty of additional information around linguistic sorting and string searching if you want to specify a different language, or do an accent-insensitive search using BINARY_AI.\n\nYou will also need to change the NLS_COMP parameter; the default value of NLS_COMP is BINARY; but, LINGUISTIC specifies that Oracle should pay attention to the value of NLS_SORT.\n\nSo, once again, you need to alter the session\n```\nalter session set nls_comp=LINGUISTIC\n```\nYou may want to create a linguistic index to improve performance\n```\ncreate index my_linguistc_index on my_table \n   (NLSSORT(column_1, 'NLS_SORT = BINARY_CI'));\n```","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I have a new SPA with a stateless authentication model using JWT. I am often asked to refer OAuth for authentication flows like asking me to send 'Bearer tokens' for every request instead of a simple token header but I do think that OAuth is a lot more complex than a simple JWT based authentication. What are the main differences, should I make the JWT authentication behave like OAuth?\nI am also using the JWT as my XSRF-TOKEN to prevent XSRF but I am being asked to keep them separate? Should I keep them separate? Any help here will be appreciated and might lead to a set of guidelines for the community.","response":"TL;DR If you have very simple scenarios, like a single client application, a single API then it might not pay off to go OAuth 2.0. On the other hand, if there are lots of different clients (browser-based, native mobile, server-side, etc) then sticking to OAuth 2.0 rules might make it more manageable than trying to roll your own system.\n\n## Detailed Answer\n\nJWT (Learn JSON Web Tokens) is just a token format. It defines a compact and self-contained mechanism for transmitting data between parties in a way that can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. Additionally, the encoding rules of a JWT also make these tokens very easy to use within the context of HTTP.\n\nBeing self-contained (the actual token contains information about a given subject), they are also a good choice for implementing stateless authentication mechanisms (aka Look mum, no sessions!). When going this route, the only thing a party must present to be granted access to a protected resource is the token itself, and the token in question can be called a bearer token.\n\nIn practice, what you're doing can already be classified as bearer token -based. However, do consider you're not using bearer tokens as specified by the OAuth 2.0 related specs (see RFC 6750). That would imply relying on the Authorization HTTP header and using the Bearer authentication scheme.\n\nRegarding the use of the JWT to prevent CSRF: Without knowing exact details it's difficult to ascertain the validity of that practice. To be honest, it does not seem correct and\/or worthwhile. The following article (Cookies vs Tokens: The Definitive Guide) may be a useful read on this subject, particularly the XSS and XSRF Protection section.\n\nOne final piece of advice. Even if you don't need to go full OAuth 2.0, I would strongly recommend on passing your access token within the Authorization header instead of going with custom headers. If they are really bearer tokens, follow the rules of RFC 6750. If not, you can always create a custom authentication scheme and still use that header.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Did the ancients or other pre-industrial civilisations engage in unsustainable practices?","response":"Most ancient agricultural practices deplete soil to some degree, but are just fine when population does not exceed certain limits. There are some examples of ancient cultures exhausting natural resources available to them - Pitcairn Island Polynesians, Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi). It's the cause of the semi-nomadic way of life of many early societies - your herds graze the grass into oblivion, you move to another patch to return back when the grass grows back in; or you deplete the soil by overplanting, you move to another spot of land and start over, and so on.\n\nBut there's an important distinction to be made. Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of.\n\nSustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels. It is about preserving the environment in human-habitable state - both by taking less from nature and by increasing effectiveness of usage of what we do need to take.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Are there any advantages while backpacking to hike during the night and sleep during the day?","response":"There are several reasons, though not all of them would apply for one's usual holiday trip.\n\n1. Remaining unseen: Obviously, during night its dark and this gives you a fair bit of cover if you want to remain unseen. This reason for traveling at night is common for many hunters in the animal kingdom (and sometimes also their prey), has been used by humans in insecure or hostile territory for centuries and remains a standard technique for some military operations even today. \n\n2. Evading the elements: Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.\n\n3. Boosting morale: When conditions get worse (cold, moisture), getting up during the night and starting to hike will not only make you feel warm again, it will also boost your morale. Being active, and actively coping with a bad situation rather than staying miserable in the tent for the rest of the night will make you feel better.\n\n4. You want to avoid tourists: No, seriously, this is a real case in point. Most people travel during the day and one of the reasons we (or at least, I) get outdoors is to enjoy some quietness in the wild. Depending where you are, hiking at night is your best bet to fulfill this dream.\n\n5. Navigation (only very theoretical): Consider a situation where it is all cloudy during the day (so you do not see the sun), you lack a compass and currently have no sense of direction: if you are capable of navigating with the stars, you might consider waiting until dark and hope that the sky will clear up until then.

They could easily be considered pure fantasy - up until the book where they discover the spacecraft that the human ancestors flew in on, and the labs where they bioengineered the dragons. \n\nIn Star Wars (arguably the most famous science fiction property of all time), the Force is really just space magic called another name. And they do all their fighting with swords. \n\nThe lists go on and on. Science fiction and fantasy are united in that they explore the impossible. Fantasy uses elements that will never be possible, while science fiction uses elements that theoretically might be possible. But the impossibility is shared. \n\n## Science fiction and fantasy are not a single genre - they are many\n\nEpic fantasy (eg Wheel of Time) and space opera (eg Star Wars) are more similar to each other than they are to urban fantasy or \"hard\" science fiction. \n\nIn some ways, it's inaccurate to call science fiction and fantasy genres at all.  They're setting elements. A romance doesn't stop being a romance because it's set on a space station, and a murder mystery isn't any less mysterious because it was an elf who was murdered.\n\nThe key to mixing these elements successfully is to understand the expectations of your readers, and meeting those expectations  (but in surprising ways).  Genre helps define expectations.\n\nIf you're writing hard SF, readers expect to see a world that's close enough to our own that they can believe that our world could become the world of the story - magic obviously has no place here. \n\nOn the flip side, urban fantasy readers expect the author to have considered the modern world and how it might interact with the impossible.  Extrapolations from science to science fiction may be natural depending on the exact nature of the setting.\n\nIf the reader has led to expect that the serial killer is a Scooby-Doo villain, then the sudden reveal that the murders were done with actual magic will violate their expectations and frustrate them (in general - there will of course be exceptions).  But if the story is framed as a space cop trying to capture a vampire despite not believing that vampires are real, the readers will accept that premise as well as any other.

{"instruction":"Why are prions in animal diets not destroyed by the digestive system?","response":"Proteases are enzymes in your digestive system that help break down food, acting like molecular-sized scissors that cut up proteins.\n\nProteases have clefts, or subpockets, into which proteins fit, where the substrate (protein) gets cut.\n\nInfectious or pathogenic prions are resistant to proteases, because of their three-dimensional shape, which hides away parts of the prion that would normally fit in proteases and which would cause the prion to be digested.\n\nPrions that do not cause disease \u2014 normal prions \u2014 have a different three-dimensional shape that allow them to fit into proteases, and so they are not resistant to digestion:\n\nA wealth of evidence contends that the infectious pathogen causing the prion diseases, also referred to as spongiform encephalopathies, is solely comprised of PrPSc, the pathogenic isoform of the prion protein (21-23). Both PrPSc and its normal cellular counterpart, PrPC, are encoded by a cellular gene (2, 19). Physical and molecular characterization of PrPSc and PrPC has failed to reveal any chemical differences between the two isoforms (32). However, PrPSc acquires distinctive conformational characteristics upon its conversion from PrPC. Whereas PrPC is soluble in most detergents and can be easily digested by proteases, PrPScis insoluble in detergents and maintains a protease-resistant core, designated PrP27-30, which polymerizes into amyloid (25).\n\nDr. Neena Singh also discovered that prions &quot;piggyback&quot; or attach to another protein called ferritin, as they make their way through the digestive system:\n\nDisease-causing prions are thought to have passed into people when they ate beef from infected cattle, triggering the brain wasting condition called new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD. But researchers have not been sure exactly how prions enter the body.\nTo find out, Neena Singh and her team at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, mimicked the process of eating and digesting infected meat.\nThey mashed up brain tissue that contained prions from patients who had a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They then exposed it to a range of harsh digestive enzymes from the mouth, stomach and intestine, which normally break proteins into pieces.\nPrions, which are known to be enormously tough, escape this attack almost unscathed, they showed, as does a second type of protein called ferritin, which stores iron and is abundant in meat. The two proteins seem to stick together, they report in the Journal of Neuroscience.\nThe researchers next added the digested slurry to a lab model of the human gut: a growing sheet of cells from the intestinal lining. By attaching fluorescent tags to the two proteins, they showed that they are transported through the cells hand-in-hand. &quot;Prions probably ride piggyback&quot; through the gut wall into the body, Singh says.\n\nAttaching to ferritin may provide additional protection from digestion, insofar as this removes prions from the digestive system, where proteases are concentrated.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

So, the difference between `stop` and `start` is the number of elements selected (if `step` is 1, the default).\n\nThe other feature is that `start` or `stop` may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:\n```\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n```\nSimilarly, `step` may be a negative number:\n```\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n```\n\nPython is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and ```a``` only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.\n\n## Relationship with the ```slice``` object\n\nA slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:\n```\na[start:stop:step]\n```\nis equivalent to:\n```\na[slice(start, stop, step)]\n```\n\nSlice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both ```slice(stop)``` and ```slice(start, stop[, step])``` are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use ```None```, so that e.g. ```a[start:]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(start, None)]``` or ```a[::-1]``` is equivalent to ```a[slice(None, None, -1)]```.\n\nWhile the ```:```-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of ```slice()``` objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

A good example is cave dwelling Troglodyte type species that have lost the ability to see. They haven't actually devolved to not have eyes, they simply did not need them and evolved to save valuable energy and nutrients by not growing a sight organ that would be useless in their environment. It isn't devolution, it's still evolution since they are changing to better suit their environment. So, at least as far as natural processes go, a species would need to become stuck in an environment for a few hundred thousand years that heavily discourages intellect, sociability, communication skills, culture, and inventiveness. That's a tough one to come up with since such traits are usually the most powerful ones for surviving something.\n\nSo here's the environment and scenario I'm thinking of. Your smart guy race is in the stone age, its pretty much on par with homo sapiens and where they were at about 10,000-15,000 years ago. But something catastrophic doesn't happen. The world slowly becomes a perfect Eden with very few predators, a perfect climate, and vast endless fields of grain and forests of fruit bearing trees. No ice age, no super-predators like we saw in said ice age. No famines or depredation, no rabid competition between several human subspecies for the same resources. The planet (Henceforth known as paradise) is literally perfect. Too perfect. Why would a species that has as close as possible to absolutely nothing to worry about need to even develop the ability to worry? Those big craniums and complex brains waste space and make childbirth more dangerous than necessary. There is absolutely nothing gained by possessing speech, abstract thought, or cooperative culture when all a species needs to do to be successful is to wander around placidly in small familial groups grazing mindlessly on the limitless amounts of food. Shelter is utterly not necessary since you have a perfect climate, nor is clothing, and food is so ludicrously plentiful there is no need to make tools.

The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it. It is very light reading, and it really geared for the young person starting their career. \n\nNow, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of \"investing\" to think about:\n\n1. Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)\n2. Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)\n\nFor most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first. Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.\n\nThere are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government. All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!\n\nYour employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match. This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period. No investment you make on your own will ever match that. Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k. (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)\n\n***The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.***\n\nBeyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own. You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k. The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.\n\nKeep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much \"walled off\" from your day-to-day financial life. Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties. You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.\n\nOne other thing to note: Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into. Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested. You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments.

Apparently, there is also something called quantum gate teleportation.\nWhat is quantum gate teleportation and what is it used for?\nI am particularly interested in possible applications in simulating quantum circuits.","response":"Quantum gate teleportation is the act of being able to apply a quantum gate on the unknown state while it is being teleported. This is one of the ways in which measurement-based computation can be described using graph states.\n\nUsually, teleportation works by having an unknown quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ held by Alice, and two qubits in the Bell state $|\\Psi\\rangle=(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)\/\\sqrt{2}$ shared between Alice and Bob. Alice performs a Bell state measurement, getting one of 4 possible answers and Bob holds on his qubit, depending on the measurement result of Alice, one of the 4 states $|\\psi\\rangle,X|\\psi\\rangle,Z|\\psi\\rangle,ZX|\\psi\\rangle.$ So, once Bob learns what result Alice got, he can compensate by applying the appropriate Paulis.\n\nLet $U$ be a 1-qubit unitary. Assume Alice and Bob share $(\\mathbb{I}\\otimes U)|\\Psi\\rangle$ instead of $|\\Psi\\rangle$. If they repeat the teleportation protocol, Bob now has one of $U|\\psi\\rangle,UX|\\psi\\rangle,UZ|\\psi\\rangle,UZX|\\psi\\rangle$, which we can rewrite as $U|\\psi\\rangle,(UXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle,(UZXU^\\dagger)U|\\psi\\rangle.$ The compensations that Bob has to make for a given measurement result are given by the bracketed terms. Often, these are no worse than the compensations you would have to make for normal teleportation (i.e. just the Pauli rotations). For example, if $U$ is the Hadamard rotation, then the corrections are just $(\\mathbb{I},Z,X,XZ)$ respectively. So, you can apply the Hadamard during teleportation just be changing the state that you teleport through (There is a strong connection here to the Choi-Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism). You can do the same for Pauli gates, and the phase gate $\\sqrt{Z}=S$. Moreover, if you repeat this protocol to build up a more complicated computation, it is often sufficient to keep a record of what these corrections are, and to apply them later.\n\nEven if you don't only need the Pauli gates (as is the case for $T=\\sqrt{S}$), the compensations may be easier than implementing the gate directly. This is the basis of the construction of the fault-tolerant T gate.\n\nIn fact, you can do something similar to apply a controlled-NOT between a pair of qubits as well. This time, the state you need is $|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}|\\Psi\\rangle_{A_1B_1}$, and a controlled-NOT applied between $B_1$ and $B_2$. This time, there are 16 possible compensating rotations, but all of them are just about how Pauli operations propagate through the action of a controlled-NOT and, again, that just gives Pauli operations out.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"What's the best way to iterate over the items in a ```HashMap```?","response":"Extracted from the reference How to Iterate Over a Map in Java:\nThere are several ways of iterating over a ```Map``` in Java. Let's go over the most common methods and review their advantages and disadvantages. Since all maps in Java implement the Map interface, the following techniques will work for any map implementation (```HashMap```, ```TreeMap```, ```LinkedHashMap```, ```Hashtable```, etc.)\n\nMethod #1: Iterating over entries using a For-Each loop.\nThis is the most common method and is preferable in most cases. It should be used if you need both map keys and values in the loop.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Map.Entry entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nNote that the For-Each loop was introduced in Java 5, so this method is working only in newer versions of the language. Also a For-Each loop will throw ```NullPointerException``` if you try to iterate over a map that is null, so before iterating you should always check for null references.\n\nMethod #2: Iterating over keys or values using a For-Each loop.\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, you can iterate over keySet or values instead of entrySet.\n```Map map = new HashMap();\n\/\/ Iterating over keys only\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key);\n}\n\/\/ Iterating over values only\nfor (Integer value : map.values()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis method gives a slight performance advantage over ```entrySet``` iteration (about 10% faster) and is more clean.\n\nMethod #3: Iterating using Iterator.\nUsing Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator> entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = entries.next();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n```\nWithout Generics:\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) entries.next();\n    Integer key = (Integer)entry.getKey();\n    Integer value = (Integer)entry.getValue();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nYou can also use same technique to iterate over ```keySet``` or values.\nThis method might look redundant, but it has its own advantages. First of all, it is the only way to iterate over a map in older versions of Java. The other important feature is that it is the only method that allows you to remove entries from the map during iteration by calling ```iterator.remove()```. If you try to do this during For-Each iteration you will get \"unpredictable results\" according to Javadoc.\nFrom a performance point of view this method is equal to a For-Each iteration.\n\nMethod #4: Iterating over keys and searching for values (inefficient).\n```Map map = new HashMap();\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    Integer value = map.get(key);\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n```\nThis might look like a cleaner alternative for method #1, but in practice it is pretty slow and inefficient as getting values by a key might be time-consuming (this method in different Map implementations is 20%-200% slower than method #1). If you have FindBugs installed, it will detect this and warn you about inefficient iteration. This method should be avoided.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you need only keys or values from the map, use method #2. If you are stuck with older version of Java (less than 5) or planning to remove entries during iteration, you have to use method #3. Otherwise use method #1.","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution; this is what you taste. It's like \"salt and pepper\", but for water.\n\nSlightly acidic water is usually popular, hence lemon juice is sometimes used to taint a jug of water in times when no carbonated water is available.\n\nCarbonated water releases CO2 bubbles for many minutes after pressure is released (dissolved carbonic acid reforming), which is an important presentation effect that other gases do not generally have.\n\nIn many countries the local water supply is slightly alkaline (due to limestone rock being very common), and this can leave a bad after-taste, and make food in your mouth taste soapy. The addition of weak acids to water helps with neutralising this effect.\n\nAround the world, some lucky towns have natural springs with effervescent water (carbonated water), and man-made carbonated water is just imitating this.

It's used mainly when bubbles are required, but not an acidic taste.\n\nOxygen is unsuitable for water pressurisation as very little can be dissolved at normal soda pressures, and it has no taste, but may readily form unwanted chemical compounds.\n\nIn the 18th century, Joseph Priestley was the first person to document this manufacturing discovery. He noted precisely that it tasted good, and that it was similar to the German Selters water. He was discovering \"airs\" (gases), and uniquely identified quite a few different gases. CO2 was the only one he listed as tasting good. His cheap source of CO2 was the fermenting grains from the nearby brewery.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"When are Decision Diagrams the right way to model and solve a problem?","response":"Decision diagrams (DDs) are most effective when they can compactly represent a large (perhaps exponential) set of solutions. This is done by merging equivalent states in each layer. To make decision diagrams scalable, we can use relaxed decision diagrams which allow merging nodes that are not necessarily equivalent. Relaxed decision diagrams provide dual bounds on the objective function -- a larger width can produce a stronger bound.\nThe relationship between the size of the decision diagram and the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem is well studied in the computer science literature; see for example the textbook by Wegener. The most important feature that influences the size is the variable ordering. We can use this to come up with some general guidelines on when a DD may be successful for combinatorial optimization:\n\n* The problem has a sequential structure, and decisions for stage $i$ depend only on the decisions made in stages $i-k$ through $i-1$, for small $k$.\n* The induced width of the constraint graph of the problem is small.\n* For a MIP model, the constraint matrix has a small bandwidth.\n* For knapsack-like problems, the maximum `budget' is relatively small.\n\nNote that in some of the above cases, precise characterization of 'small' may yield (pseudo-)polynomial bounds on the size of the exact DD. In practice, relaxed DDs will always have polynomial size.\nThere are several areas of combinatorial optimization in which decision diagrams have been successfully applied:\n\n* Sequencing and routing problems. For example, single machine scheduling with setup times, time windows, and\/or precedence constraints, which can also be applied to constrained traveling salesperson problems. A similar decision diagram representation was used by Grubhub to solve pickup-and-delivery problems.\n* Decomposition and embedding in MIP models. Decision diagrams have been used to represent subproblems in MIP models that are otherwise difficult to linearize. For example, to represent nonlinear objective functions, constrained employee schedules, or nonlinear circuit design. DDs have also been used in column generation.\n* Graph-theoretic problems. Examples include set covering, maximum independent set, and maximum cut.\n* Constraint programming. Constraint propagation based on (relaxed) decision diagrams can be much more effective than propagating domains of individual variables. This was first demonstrated on overlapping alldifferent constraints.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

The network then decides which location to route a user request to, based on routing protocol costs and possibly the 'health' of the advertising servers.\n\nThere are several benefits to anycast. First, in steady state, users of an anycast service (DNS is an excellent example) will always connect to the 'closest' (from a routing protocol perspective) DNS server. This reduces latency, as well as providing a level of load-balancing (assuming that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network).\nAnother advantage is ease of configuration management. Rather than having to configure different DNS servers depending on where a server\/workstation is deployed (Asia, America, Europe), you have one IP address that is configured in every location.\n\nDepending on how anycast is implemented, it can also provide a level of high availability. If the advertisement of the anycast route is conditional on some sort of health check (e.g. a DNS query for a well known domain, in this example), then as soon as a server fails its route can be removed. Once the network reconverges, user requests will be seamlessly forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS, without the need for any manual intervention or reconfiguration.\n\nA final advantage is that of horizontal scaling; if you find that one server is being overly loaded, simply deploy another one in a location that would allow it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests. Again, as no client configuration is required, this can be done very quickly.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Anycast is a networking technique.","max_prob":25.2557201385,"ccp":-0.0000317108},{"claim":"The same IP prefix is advertised from multiple locations in anycast.","max_prob":41.2715759277,"ccp":-0.0000251064},{"claim":"The network decides which location to route a user request to.","max_prob":24.8078727722,"ccp":-0.0777533452},{"claim":"The decision is based on routing protocol costs.","max_prob":17.10297966,"ccp":-0.1211383522},{"claim":"The decision is possibly based on the 'health' of the advertising servers.","max_prob":24.3371181488,"ccp":-0.0000175744},{"claim":"In steady state, users of an anycast service will connect to a DNS server.","max_prob":39.0380439758,"ccp":-0.0005486695},{"claim":"DNS is an example of an anycast service.","max_prob":8.7570734024,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"Users will connect to the 'closest' DNS server from a routing protocol perspective.","max_prob":25.3993186951,"ccp":-0.2505355117},{"claim":"This reduces latency.","max_prob":3.6948707104,"ccp":-0.3551911414},{"claim":"This provides a level of load-balancing.","max_prob":12.6596727371,"ccp":-0.0462845325},{"claim":"The load-balancing assumes that your consumers are evenly distributed around your network.","max_prob":32.8087539673,"ccp":-0.0930075399},{"claim":"Different DNS servers are configured depending on the deployment location of a server\/workstation.","max_prob":34.9119911194,"ccp":-0.1053207844},{"claim":"Deployment locations mentioned are Asia, America, and Europe.","max_prob":18.3767490387,"ccp":-0.0011175253},{"claim":"One IP address is configured in every location.","max_prob":15.8763303757,"ccp":-0.9866427894},{"claim":"Anycast can be implemented in different ways.","max_prob":4.4617071152,"ccp":-0.3466205186},{"claim":"Anycast can provide a level of high availability.","max_prob":11.2698488235,"ccp":-0.0638736075},{"claim":"The advertisement of the anycast route can be conditional on a health check.","max_prob":22.3124084473,"ccp":-0.0043979414},{"claim":"A DNS query for a well-known domain can be used as a health check.","max_prob":49.1595726013,"ccp":-0.0030205692},{"claim":"If a server fails the health check, its route can be removed.","max_prob":17.3086090088,"ccp":-0.1217347574},{"claim":"The network will reconverge.","max_prob":12.7188873291,"ccp":-0.18643943},{"claim":"User requests will be forwarded to the next closest instance of DNS.","max_prob":27.4151039124,"ccp":-0.8923411069},{"claim":"The forwarding of user requests will be seamless.","max_prob":19.6787815094,"ccp":-0.7810281623},{"claim":"There will be no need for manual intervention.","max_prob":8.4176187515,"ccp":-0.1794389863},{"claim":"There will be no need for reconfiguration.","max_prob":14.3380470276,"ccp":-0.1542470435},{"claim":"Horizontal scaling is an advantage.","max_prob":16.7507953644,"ccp":-0.0957721852},{"claim":"If one server is being overly loaded, you can deploy another server.","max_prob":27.2317390442,"ccp":-0.0140644972},{"claim":"Deploying another server can be done in a location that allows it to take some proportion of the overloaded server's requests.","max_prob":49.5321807861,"ccp":-0.192947493},{"claim":"No client configuration is required.","max_prob":13.7307653427,"ccp":-0.0000483826},{"claim":"This can be done very quickly.","max_prob":5.7518901825,"ccp":-0.8783038484}]}

So the integers are countable.\n\nWe proved this by finding a map between the integers and the natural numbers.

There is a 1-1 mapping between the elements in $\\mathbb N$ and the elements in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$\n\nSo how do we prove this? We need to find a correspondence, of course. Fortunately, there's a simple way to do this. Let $s_{nm}$ be the $mth$ element of $S_n$. We can do this because $S_n$ is by definition of the problem countable. We can write the elements of ALL the sets like this:\n$$s_{11}, s_{12}, s_{13} ...$$\n$$s_{21}, s_{22}, s_{23} ...$$\n$$s_{31}, s_{32}, s_{33} ...$$\n$$...$$\nNow let $1 \\mapsto s_{11}$, $2 \\mapsto s_{12}$, $3 \\mapsto s_{21}$, $4 \\mapsto s_{13}$, etc. You might notice that if we cross out every element that we've mapped, we're crossing them out in diagonal lines. With $1$ we cross out the first diagonal, $2-3$ we cross out the second diagonal, $4-6$ the third diagonal, $7-10$ the fourth diagonal, etc. The $nth$ diagonal requires us to map $n$ elements to cross it out. Since we never \"run out\" of elements in $\\mathbb N$, eventually given any diagonal we'll create a map to every element in it. Since obviously every element in $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ...$ is in one of the diagonals, we've created a 1-1 map between $\\mathbb N$ and the set of sets.\n\nLet's extend this one step further. What if we made $s_{11} = 1\/1$, $s_{12} = 1\/2$, $s_{21} = 2\/1$, etc? Then $S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup S_3 ... = \\mathbb Q^+$! This is how you prove that the rationals are countable. Well, the positive rationals anyway. Can you extend these proofs to show that the rationals are countable?","primary_tag":"Math","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Sim, ele pode causar muito mal, assim como qualquer padr\u00e3o de projeto aplicado indevidamente sem an\u00e1lise do impacto e dos efeitos colaterais.\n\n###Porque n\u00e3o usar\n* Acoplamento. Ao usar um Singleton voc\u00ea est\u00e1 acoplando o c\u00f3digo a uma implementa\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1tica e espec\u00edfica. Isso torna o seu c\u00f3digo dependente dessa classe e impede, por exemplo, criar mocks em testes unit\u00e1rios. Desse ponto de vista a consequ\u00eancia \u00e9 basicamente a mesma de fazer diretamente um ```new MeuObjetoImportante()```, pois \u00e9 uma depend\u00eancia direta da classe.\n* Escopo. O padr\u00e3o Singleton aplicado conforme a defini\u00e7\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m elimina o conceito de escopo. Isso significa que se voc\u00ea por alguma raz\u00e3o decidir que para determinados componentes da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o voc\u00ea precisa de outra implementa\u00e7\u00e3o ter\u00e1 que alterar manualmente todas as classes.\n* N\u00e3o garantia de uma inst\u00e2ncia \u00fanica. Em certos casos o padr\u00e3o pode levar \u00e0 falsa seguran\u00e7a de que existir\u00e1 apenas uma inst\u00e2ncia. Vamos supor que voc\u00ea projete um sistema web e quer dar acesso a um arquivo ou recurso exclusivo. Um Singleton parece uma boa pr\u00e1tica, n\u00e3o \u00e9? Mas e se amanh\u00e3 voc\u00ea fizer o deploy da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em um cluster com N servidores.\n\nNo caso de Java isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem complicado, pois n\u00e3o existe isso de uma classe por JVM. O conceito correto \u00e9 uma classe por ```ClassLoader```, de forma que num mesmo servidor JEE duas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes podem ter, cada uma, sua pr\u00f3pria vers\u00e3o de uma mesma classe. As vari\u00e1veis est\u00e1ticas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o compartilhadas entre essas vers\u00f5es da mesma classe, portanto o escopo do Singleton em Java \u00e9 por ```ClassLoader``` e n\u00e3o por programa.\n\n###Porque usar\nEm algumas situa\u00e7\u00f5es voc\u00ea sabe que vai ter s\u00f3 uma inst\u00e2ncia da classe. Em uma aplica\u00e7\u00e3o Desktop, por exemplo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 porque ter \"frescuras\" adicionais para obter uma conex\u00e3o com o banco de dados. \nTamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o vejo problemas em um objeto encapsulando alguns atributos de configura\u00e7\u00e3o globais. Simplesmente n\u00e3o valeria o esfor\u00e7o de implementar algum mecanismo muito elaborado para algo t\u00e3o simples.\n\n###Como usar\nQuando pensamos em Singleton, logo a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o cl\u00e1ssica do Gang of Four nos v\u00eam \u00e0 mente. Os t\u00f3picos anteriores desta resposta consideraram isso. Por\u00e9m, com a ascens\u00e3o do uso de frameworks de Invers\u00e3o de Controle (IoC) e Inje\u00e7\u00e3o de Depend\u00eancia (DI), existe hoje uma forma muito mais \"segura\" e flex\u00edvel de implementar o padr\u00e3o: deixe o framework cuidar disso para voc\u00ea!\n\n###Como evitar o Singleton\nApesar de implementa\u00e7\u00f5es mais simples poderem usar o padr\u00e3o Singleton da forma \"cl\u00e1ssica\" sem problemas, em geral seria melhor aplicar a Invers\u00e3o de Controle simplesmente deixar a inst\u00e2ncia de suas depend\u00eancias serem injetadas. Dessa forma, caso amanh\u00e3 os requisitos mudem e voc\u00ea preciso injetar diferentes inst\u00e2ncias, ou mesmo queira criar mocks de teste, basta configurar seu container ou framework para tal, sem alterar as implementa\u00e7\u00f5es existentes.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"The construction of Solomon's temple includes a piece of furnishing described in 1 Kings 7:23 (ESV):\n\n  Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.\n\nSo if the ```diameter = 10``` cubits and the ```circumference = 30``` cubits, then ```\u03c0 = 3``` by the equation ```C =  \u03c0 * D```.\nOf course, such an object does not exist since ```\u03c0 = 3.14159...``` yet clearly the sea was constructed at some point.  So how do we resolve this contradiction?","response":"To start with, compare the circle the diameter we're given would make with the circle the circumference we're given would make: \nSince a circumference is \u03c0 times the diameter, a 'pure' circle of 10 cubits in diameter as we describe the sea as having would be 10\u03c0 cubits in circumference, or roughly 31.4 cubits. \nNow, since the circumference attributed to our sea is only 30 cubits, it represents a smaller circle, which is 30\/\u03c0 or roughly 9.55 cubits in diameter. \nOr to tabulate it:\n```Circle A:  ~9.55 cubits diameter,  30   cubits circumference\nCircle B:  10    cubits diameter, ~31.4 cubits circumference\n```\nGiven that, we have two diameters differing by about .45 cubits (about eight inches on an 18-inch cubit--a sizable difference).  \nSince we know the sea was a physical object and not a circle bounded by an infinitesimal line, we can safely understand that the sea must be of some thickness; on this ground, it would not be unreasonable to take the shorter dimension as the inner measurement, and the longer dimension as the outer measurement, and see where that takes us.\nDividing the difference in the diameters in half, this would make the wall around our sea at least .225 cubits thick--i.e., about four inches on either end of the sea, assuming an eighteen-inch cubit. \nDo we have any authority for assuming that this is the case and saying the sea was anything like four inches thick?\nA couple of verses after this we have 1 Kings 7:26, which gives it to us outright: \n\n  Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.\n\nA handbreadth as a unit of measurement is generally given as between three and four inches.  \n(The 'Number Pi in the Bible' site linked elsewhere gives as its rebuttal to this sort of argument the statement \"The writer makes sure that no question remains: both the diameter and the circumference are taken over-all.\" - though I'm not sure on what basis he sees that.)","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Can someone please give an explanation of different egg preparations?","response":"Sure, here are different preparations of eggs:\n\n1. Fried Eggs:\n* Sunny Side Up -- Not flipped, unbroken yolk. The top of the egg is just barely set.\n* Basted -- Sunny Side Up, hot fat spooned over until the white surrounding the yolk is opaque.\n* Over Easy \/ lite -- Flipped,  whites  fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk runny.\n* Over medium -- flipped, whites fully cooked, unbroken yolk, yolk creamy (not completely runny).\n* Over Medium Well -- Flipped, unbroken yolk, yolk cooked to have a firm but wet-appearing center.\n* Over Hard -- Flipped, broken, fully-cooked yolk.\n* Over Well -- Flipped, intact, fully-cooked yolk.\n* Broken \/ Lightly Scrambled -- Broken in pan and gently stirred while cooking - yolk and whites should not be mixed entirely.\n* Scrambled Eggs -- Made in many different ways. Generally the eggs are mixed in a bowl before being put into the pan, and often stirred while cooking. Some recipes add fat to the eggs in the form of milk, * cream, butter, or oil. A distinction can be made between Wet\/Loose or Dry, which refers to the degree of doneness.\n\n2. Omelettes:\n* Filled Omelette -- Eggs mixed before cooking, possibly with added fat as in Scrambled Eggs. Cooked in fat in a saute pan; when set but the interior still wet, previously-cooked fillings (cheese, onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes...) are added, and the eggs folded over into a half-moon shape.\n* Spanish Omelette \/ Western Omelette -- Same as filled, but the egg mixture is poured over the fillings in a hot pan and cooked, thus incorporating the fillings into the egg.\n* Fluffy Omelette -- Whites and yolks beaten separately. Yolks are gently folded into the whites without breaking the structure of the whites. Optional toppings are added. Cooked slowly in a pan, or baked (an electric frying pan with a lid works well for this preparation).\n* French Omelette -- Cooked soft & creamy with no color on the egg. Omelette is folded 1\/3 in the pan, knocked to the edge so it can be rolled out onto the plate. It ends up being folded into thirds and is very creamy and soft.\n\n3. Boiled:\nCooked in shell in water for a timed period. Some people will refer to degree of doneness by cooking time, i.e., a &quot;3-minute egg&quot; is soft-boiled with some runny white around the yolk. Some recipes call for eggs to be added to boiling water, others to be started in cold water. In the cold-water start, the pot may be left on the heat or removed when the water reaches a boil. The eggs may be shocked in ice water when removed.\n* Soft -- Yolk runny, potentially with slight unset white around the yolk.\n* Medium -- White completely set, yolk firm but with a dark, wet appearance.\n* Hard -- Yolk completely set and pale yellow.\n\n4. Poached:\nEgg cooked, out of shell, in water, stock, or other liquid --  excluding fats or oils -- at a temperature in the range of 160-180\u02daF (70-82\u02daC). There are possible degrees of doneness, however the typical poached egg has a runny but warm and thickened yolk and fully-set white.\n\n5. Coddled:\nAn egg that has been very lightly cooked (poached eggs are sometimes considered coddled). This can either be accomplished with an egg coddler or cooking an egg in its shell with water that is slightly below boiling point.\n\n6. Shirred:\nAn egg cooked in an oven at the low-mid 300's\u02daF (~160\u02daC), contained in a ramekin, until the whites are just set and the yolk is runny but thickened. Often butter or another fat is placed on top before cooking.\n\n7. Steamed:\nVery similar to shirred eggs, but the ramekin is covered with some aluminum foil and put in a steamer for 7-15 minutes.\n\n8. In a basket:\nEggs fried in a hole made in a slice of bread.\n\n9. deep fried\nMoo shu- using a strainer to drop small drops of egg into hot oil in a wok and stir. Frying in vegetables and\/optionally meat or another protein then consume on mandarin pancakes with your choice of sauce.","primary_tag":"Information

So in worst case you could end with tax office refusing to acknowledge, for example, 50% of your expenses as tax costs. You would end up with fine and penalty percentages.\n\nWith donation, the danger is even greater. There was a case of baker who was giving the unsold bread to charity for free.

{"instruction":"Why are people unwilling to share information about their salary?","response":"People are unwilling to talk openly about their salaries because there is a social taboo surrounding the practice. \nLike all taboos, there isn't necessarily a good rationale behind its existence. And the taboo can, in fact, be detrimental, as it is here.\n\nAround the time of the industrial revolution, you were not allowed to talk about your wages. You could be fired if you did. Employers did this because discussing what you make is an obvious and required step towards collective bargaining.\n\nIf you discuss your wages, someone will find out they make less money than they should. If they make less money than they should, they will want more money. The people making money from underpaying people don't want to pay more. Your ignorance is a very useful tool in depressing your wages or the wages of others -- especially minorities or women -- around you.\n\nSo people learned from the early industrialists of old that they would be fired if it was found out they talked money. Those people told others of what had happened to them, that they had been fired for talking money. It snowballed from there. They spread that lesson on to others. So now, even though discussing your salary is a legally protected right, people are hesitant to exercise that right.\n\nNot discussing salary is an abusive practice.

(It could go up to five with Action Surge, though.)\n\nThe Two-Weapon Fighting rule states (PHB, page 195):\n\n>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you\u2019re holding in the other hand. You don\u2019t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\nThe bonus action used as part of Two-Weapon Fighting is an attack, but it is not the Attack action.\nWhen you are a 5th-level fighter and you take the Attack action, you can make two attacks. You can also use your bonus action to make an additional attack. Notably, you can only take one bonus action per turn, since the rules for bonus actions state:\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou only add your ability modifier to the damage of that bonus-action attack if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting fighting style (PHB, page 72):\n\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability\nmodifier to the damage of the second attack.\n\nTherefore, you are taking the Attack action (2 attacks) and then making an additional attack with your bonus action (1 attack), for a total of 3 attacks if you're using your action plus your bonus action. There's a clear difference between them.\nAction Surge lets a 5th-level fighter attack up to 5 times in one turn, once per short rest.\n\nThe description of the Action Surge feature says (PHB, page 72):\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.\n\nWhich means that if you use Action Surge, you would have 2 actions and 1 bonus action on your turn.\nSo with this, you can take your Attack action (2 attacks), then use Action Surge and take another Attack action (2 more attacks), and finally your Two-Weapon Fighting bonus action (one more attack), for a total of 5 attacks during your turn.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Therefore, the indices of the `n` highest elements are:\n```\n(-avgDists).argsort()[:n]\n```\nAnother way to reason about this, as mentioned in the comments, is to observe that the big elements are coming last in the argsort. So, you can read from the tail of the argsort to find the `n` highest elements:\n```\navgDists.argsort()[::-1][:n]\n```\nBoth methods are O(n log n) in time complexity, because the argsort call is the dominant term here. But the second approach has a nice advantage: it replaces an O(n) negation of the array with an O(1) slice. If you're working with small arrays inside loops then you may get some performance gains from avoiding that negation, and if you're working with huge arrays then you can save on memory usage because the negation creates a copy of the entire array.\n\nNote that these methods do not always give equivalent results: if a stable sort implementation is requested to argsort, e.g. by passing the keyword argument kind='mergesort', then the first strategy will preserve the sorting stability, but the second strategy will break stability (i.e. the positions of equal items will get reversed).","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Let us assume that it is centered, i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero.\n\nThen the $p \\times p$ covariance matrix $\\mathbf C$ is given by $\\mathbf C = \\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X\/(n-1)$. It is a symmetric matrix and so it can be diagonalized: $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf L \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf V$ is a matrix of eigenvectors (each column is an eigenvector) and $\\mathbf L$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ in the decreasing order on the diagonal. The eigenvectors are called principal axes or principal directions of the data. Projections of the data on the principal axes  are called principal components, also known as PC scores; these can be seen as new, transformed, variables. The $j$-th principal component is given by $j$-th column of $\\mathbf {XV}$. The coordinates of the $i$-th data point in the new PC space are given by the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{XV}$.\n\nIf we now perform singular value decomposition of $\\mathbf X$, we obtain a decomposition $$\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf U$ is a unitary matrix (with columns called left singular vectors), $\\mathbf S$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values $s_i$ and $\\mathbf V$ columns are called right singular vectors. From here one can easily see that $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf S \\mathbf U^\\top \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \/(n-1) = \\mathbf V \\frac{\\mathbf S^2}{n-1}\\mathbf V^\\top,$$ meaning that right singular vectors $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions (eigenvectors) and that singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2\/(n-1)$. Principal components are given by $\\mathbf X \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S$.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. If $\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top$, then the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions\/axes (eigenvectors).\n2. Columns of $\\mathbf {US}$ are principal components (&quot;scores&quot;).\n3. Singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2\/(n-1)$. Eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ show variances of the respective PCs.\n4. Standardized scores are given by columns of $\\sqrt{n-1}\\mathbf U$ and loadings are given by columns of $\\mathbf V \\mathbf S\/\\sqrt{n-1}$. See e.g. here and here for why &quot;loadings&quot; should not be confused with principal directions.\n5. The above is correct only if $\\mathbf X$ is centered. Only then is covariance matrix equal to $\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X\/(n-1)$.\n6. The above is correct only for $\\mathbf X$ having samples in rows and variables in columns. If variables are in rows and samples in columns, then $\\mathbf U$ and $\\mathbf V$ exchange interpretations.\n7. If one wants to perform PCA on a correlation matrix (instead of a covariance matrix), then columns of $\\mathbf X$ should not only be centered, but standardized as well, i.e. divided by their standard deviations.\n8. To reduce the dimensionality of the data from $p$ to $k&lt;p$, select $k$ first columns of $\\mathbf U$, and $k\\times k$ upper-left part of $\\mathbf S$. Their product $\\mathbf U_k \\mathbf S_k$ is the required $n \\times k$ matrix containing first $k$ PCs.\n9. Further multiplying the first $k$ PCs by the corresponding principal axes $\\mathbf V_k^\\top$ yields $\\mathbf X_k = \\mathbf U_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf S_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf V_k^\\top$ matrix that has the original $n \\times p$ size but is of lower rank (of rank $k$). This matrix $\\mathbf X_k$ provides a reconstruction of the original data from the first $k$ PCs. It has the lowest possible reconstruction error, see my answer here.\n10. Strictly speaking, $\\mathbf U$ is of $n\\times n$ size and $\\mathbf V$ is of $p \\times p$ size. However, if $n&gt;p$ then the last $n-p$ columns of $\\mathbf U$ are arbitrary (and corresponding rows of $\\mathbf S$ are constant zero); one should therefore use an economy size (or thin) SVD that returns $\\mathbf U$ of $n\\times p$ size, dropping the useless columns.

{"instruction":"Did Hillary Clinton propose to punish flag burners in 2005?","response":"The proposed law co-sponsored by Clinton in 2005 prohibits flag burning under specific circumstances. It does not attempt to make flag burning illegal in general (i.e. outside of those specific circumstances). Clinton has voted against a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general.\n\nIn 2005, Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, whose summary is as follows:\n\n> Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.\n\nIt seems like a reaction to ongoing efforts to pass a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to ban flag burning, a move that the co-sponsors of the 2005 act oppose and voted against. Its text notes:\n\n> the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by free and democratic nations\n\nbut suggests that flag burning with intent to incite violence is not protected by the Constitution (unlike flag burning as political expression, which is protected):\n\n> destruction of the flag of the United States can be intended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement and such conduct is outside the protections afforded by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n\nNote that the distinction between \n\n* banning flag burning for being offensive, and \n* banning flag burning when it incites violence or disturbs the peace\n\nis an important one. The Flag Protection Act proposed in 2005 was essentially a replacement for a previous Flag Protection Act that banned flag burning in general:\n\n> Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\nbut this was deemed unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 in 1990, on the basis of their earlier (1989) decision in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397. There, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n> an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct\n\nbut that in the case under consideration, this did not apply:\n\n> An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record. \n\nand further noted that \n\n> Expression may not be prohibited [p398] on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.\n\nClinton was not one of the 59 co-sponsors of a proposed amendment to the constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general:\n\n> Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\nand she also voted against it.

{"instruction":"There are several questions here about the definition of depth of field, about focal length, and about subject distance. And of course there's the basic how does aperture affect my photographs. And plenty of how do I get super-shallow d.o.f questions. There's related questions like this one. But there's no be-all-end-all question asking:\nWhat exactly determines depth of field in a photograph? \nIs it just a property of the lens? Can lenses be designed to give more depth of field for the same aperture and focal length? Does it change with camera sensor size? Does it change with print size? How do those last two relate?","response":"I'm going to dispense with the formulas, photos of rulers and definitions of \"magnification\" and go with what you actually experience in practice. The major factors that actually matter to shooting are:\n\n* Aperture. Wide aperture lenses give you a shallower depth of field. This is probably the least controversial factor! This is important as some lenses have much larger apertures e.g. 18-55 f\/3.5-5.6 vs. 50 f\/1.8 \n* Subject distance. This is a really important consideration. Depth of field gets drastically shallower when you start to get really close. This is important as at macro focussing distances DoF is a major problem. It also means you can get shallow DoF regardless of aperture if you get close enough, and that if you want deep DoF in low light compose to focus further away.\n* Focal length. This does affect depth of field, but only in certain ranges, when maintaining subject size. Wide lenses have very deep depth of field at most subject distances. Once you get past a certain point, DoF changes very little with focal length. This is important again because if you want to increase \/ decrease DoF you can use focal length to do this whilst still filling the frame with your subject.\n* Sensor size. This affects DoF when you maintain the same subject distance and field of view between sensor sizes. The bigger the sensor the shallower the depth of field. DSLRs have much bigger sensors than compacts, and so for the same FoV and f-ratio they have shallower DoF. This is important because by the same token cropping images increases DoF when maintaining the same final output size, as it's akin to using a smaller sensor.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why did the NES not allow rotated sprites?","response":"For each sprite displayed on a scanline, the hardware fetches two bytes from memory, and then clocks the pixels out one by one. The sprite is eight pixels wide, and each pixel is two bits, which is why it's two memory accesses per sprite per scanline. You can imagine that this arrangement just needs a couple of shift registers to clock the pixels out.\n\nNow, flipping the sprite about its vertical axis is easy: you just clock the pixels out in reverse order! Similarly, flipping the sprite about its horizontal axis is also easy: You just fetch the bitmap from memory in reverse order. Rotating by 180\u00b0 of course is the same as flipping both horizontally and vertically.\n\nBut if you wanted to rotate the sprite 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, that's much harder. That's because the hardware would need to get one pixel from each pair of bytes, which means fetching 16 bytes from memory instead of just two. There is not enough time on this slow hardware to do that. Incidentally, this is also where the maximum number of sprites per scanline limitation comes from.\n\nIt's a similar story on the Commodore 64, the Atari 2600, and many others: These platforms can do some simple 2D manipulations on sprites like stretching and sometimes flipping like you've seen, but never rotations.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

The important point is that at a fixed sampling rate, increasing frequency resolution decreases temporal resolution. That is the more accurate your measurement in the frequency domain, the less accurate you can be in the time domain. You effectively lose all time information inside the FFT length.\n\nIn this example, if a 1999 Hz tone starts and stops in the first half of the 8192 sample FFT and a 2002 Hz tone plays in the second half of the window, we would see both, but they would appear to have occurred at the same time.\n\nYou also have to consider processing time.  A 8192 point FFT takes some decent processing power.  A way to reduce this need is to reduce the sampling rate, which is the second way to increase frequency resolution.\n\nIn your example, if you drop your sampling rate to something like 4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1 Hz bins *4096 Hz, then you only need a 4096 point FFT to achieve 1hz bins and can still resolve a 2khz signal.  This reduces the FFT bin size, but also reduces the bandwidth of the signal.\n\nUltimately with an FFT there will always be a trade off between frequency resolution and time resolution.  You have to perform a bit of a balancing act to reach all goals.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Math,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Road bike tires have tread patterns because they sell better, not because they perform better.\nHere's some questions to ask to decide about replacing a tire:\n\n* Can you see any of the fabric?\n* Are you getting flats more easily than you used to?\n* Is any part of the tire bulging out or lumpy?\n* Are there visible holes\/gashes in the tire?\n* Does the wear indicator indicate you should replace?  (Some tires have dimples or grooves that are there to indicate when the tire should be replaced.

If you're on hard surfaces such as pavement\/asphalt, the tread doesn't help you and actually slightly reduces contact area and increases rolling resistance.  On most road tires the minimal tread pattern is just cosmetic to make their customers feel better (since a smooth tire looks slippery).\n\nSee also: Sheldon Brown's comments on tire replacement and tread patterns\nIf you plan to ride through mud, sand or other soft surfaces, you need tread.

{"instruction":"Why is kVA not the same as kW?","response":"Both watts and volt-amps come from the same equation, $P=IV$, but the difference is how they're measured.\nTo get volt-amps, you multiply root mean square (RMS) voltage ($V$) with RMS current ($I$) with no regard for the timing\/phasing between them. This is what the wiring and pretty much all electrical\/electronic components have to deal with.\n\nTo get watts, you multiply instantaneous voltage ($V$) with instantaneous current ($I$) for every sample, then average those results. This is the energy that is actually transferred.\n\nNow to compare the two measurements:\nIf voltage and current are both sinewaves, then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps} \\times \\cos(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the phase angle between voltage and current. It's pretty easy to see from this that if they're both sine waves and if they're in phase ($\\phi = 0$), then $\\text{watts} = \\text{volt-amps}$.\n\nHowever, if you're NOT dealing with sine waves, the $\\cos(\\phi)$ relationship no longer applies! So you have to go the long way around and actually do the measurements as described here.\n\nHow might that happen? Easy. DC power supplies. They're everywhere, including battery chargers, and the vast majority of them only draw current at the peak of the AC voltage waveform because that's the only time that their filter capacitors are otherwise less than the input voltage. So they draw a big spike of current to recharge the caps, starting just before the voltage peak and ending right at the voltage peak, and then they draw nothing until the next peak.\n\nAnd of course there's an exception to this rule also, and that is Power Factor Correction (PFC). DC power supplies with PFC are specialized switching power supplies that end up producing more DC voltage than the highest AC peak, and they do it in such a way that their input current follows the input voltage almost exactly. Of course, this is only an approximation, but the goal is to get a close enough match that the $\\cos(\\phi)$ shortcut becomes acceptably close to accurate, with $\\phi \\approx 0$. Then, given this high voltage DC, a secondary switching supply produces what is actually required by the circuit being powered.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"In this Creation magazine reprint of a 1994 article titled Exploding stars point to a young universe,  Young-Earth Creationist, Jonathan Sarfati argues that the scarcity of Supernova remnants (SNRs) in the sky suggests the Milky Way galaxy is less than billions of years old.\n\nOn average, a galaxy like our own, the Milky Way, should produce one supernova every 25 years.\n[...]\nAs can be readily seen above, a young universe model fits the data of the low number of observed SNRs. If the universe was really billions of years old, there are 7000 missing SNRs in our galaxy.\n\nDoes astronomy predict a Milky Way supernova every 25 years? Are there missing SNRs that undermine these predictions?","response":"There are many reasons why this is wrong. The first one is the assumption of 1 supernova per 25 years. That was the value arrived at in Gustav Tammann's article published in 1970. Others got values up to 100 years (Tammann himself changed his value later). All these values are really only good guesses.\n\nWorse errors are made in the percentage of remnants that should be visible. To start with, only a small percentage of them are visible; the others are obscured by dust in the galaxy. This does not happen to the same extent to the supernovas themselves, as they are intrinsically very much brighter. \n\nSarfati also uses an old paper to come up with the number of remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way). However, that figure was considered to be wrong (and much smaller) in later studies. Older remnants are very difficult to distinguish against a background of dust in the galaxy. Many of them disappear completely after about 10,000 years or so.\n\nIt should be noted that, using Sarfati's own reasoning, we should not be able to see any remnants older than 6000 years. Instead, we know of remnants (e.g. G166.2 + 2.5) that are over 100,000 years old. How did those originate in his universe? The same goes for the distance to supernovas. The distance to SN 1987A has been trigonometrically measured at 167,000 light years (the paper says 51,200 parsecs). In other words, its light took more than 30 times longer to reach us than the creationist universe has supposedly existed. \n\nRemember also that a supernova typically becomes either a pulsar or a black hole, both of which are very hard to observe. A black hole can only be \"seen\" through its effects on other matter, and a pulsar is mainly visible if the solar system happens to be in line with its sweeping radio beam (with some pulsars the star itself has also been seen). Hence, all we can see of them long after the event is an expanding cloud of gas that gets dimmer over the millennia.\n\nThere are several other reasons which are covered in a very good article on TalkOrigins. That article has links to all the original scientific papers referred to, so you can check the validity yourself.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why is there so much technical detail of whaling included in Moby-Dick?","response":"There are multiple purposes behind the novel structure of Moby-Dick.\n\nIn the first instance the author was himself a whaleman, having spent 18 months as an ordinary seaman aboard the whaler Acushnet in 1841\u201342. In his experience the literature of the day, such as Miriam \n\nCoffin or The Whale-Fisherman by Joseph Hart, did not portray whaling accurately but rather sensationalised it. He wished to provide his readers with a more realistic account.\n\nIn doing so, he also gave the reader the information necessary to better understand and appreciate the passages of whaling described in the novel. With the reader forewarned, he is able to keep the narrative passages tense and exciting. It is interesting that, early in the novel, the Pequod meets virutally no whales and that the chases become longer and more involved as the story progresses. This may be because Melville felt he needed to give the reader more and more technical information before they could fully appreicate these encounters, but understood the science would need to be spaced out among the narrative.\n\nIn describing it to the reader, the science also serves another useful narrative function. It indicates that on whaling voyages, long periods of time pass when nothing much happens at all. By padding out of the story with scientific digressions serves as a useful narrative metaphor for waiting.\n\nThe level of detail provided also mirrors one of the novel's central themes: obsession. Although Ishmael is the narrator and Ahab the obvious obsessive, the amount of science indicates that Ishmael is also an obsessive. His obsession is the business of whaling itself.\n\nFinally, Melville made good use of these passages in serving as metaphors for other themes of the novel where he felt it appropriate. For example in the chapter The Line, which describes how the whale line is stored and used in the boat, it ends by using the line as a metaphor.\n\n  \"All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\"\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why are we building larger land-based telescopes instead of launching larger ones into space?","response":"Because it's cheaper.\n(1) With adaptive optics you can get 0.1 arc second resolution on the ground (admittedly only on a mountain top with particularly good air flow, but still!). This eliminates one of the major advantages of space until you get above several meters mirror diameter.\n(2) Rocket fairings are the shrouds which protect payloads during the supersonic atmospherics speeds reached during launch. A 5 meter fairing is about the largest that can be flown, which limits the size of the one-piece mirrors which can be launched.  (The Dreaded Webb Telescope's mirror is in pieces which will assemble themselves in space -- a very scary and very expensive piece of design.)\n(3) Servicing a telescope on the top of Mauna Kea or in the high Chilean Andes is a difficult and expensive process. Servicing a telescope in orbit makes that look like small change.  (Cost comparable to the cost of building a new giant scope on Earth.) And in-orbit servicing can't even be done with current technology except in low earth orbit.\n(4) While high resolution is one frontier in astronomy, going deep is another, and going deep requires big mirrors.  A 30 meter mirror on Earth gathers much more light than a 5 meter mirror in space.  The giant terrestrial telescopes simply do a better job of being light buckets for spectroscopy than anything we can yet put into space.\n\nThe bottom line is that with the development of adaptive optics, space-based telescopes of currently buildable and launchable size lost their main advantage over ground-based telescopes.  And since they're 10x to 100x the cost, they are simply not worth building for many purposes.\n\nSpace based telescopes still hold a significant edge in parts of the spectrum blocked by the atmosphere such as UV and IR (Webb), and for certain tasks involving long-term high accuracy photometry (Kepler) and astrometry (Gaia).  But for general purpose use, the balance seems firmly on the ground's side for large telescopes.\n\nThis will change if space flight becomes cheaper -- the SpaceX BFR, for example, with its 9 meter fairing and dramatically lower launch costs, offers great hope for space telescopes.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why can we see the dust particles in a narrow beam of light (and not in an all lighted area)?","response":"Your inability to see the dust until you narrow the slit has nothing to do with the narrowness of the beam but instead the dynamic range of light that your eye can see at one time.\nA bit of searching turns up reports of a contrast ratio for you eye at one time as between 100:1 and 1000:1. This means if you're in a room with a range of brightness greater than about 100 to 1 the brightest things will all be washed out as white and the darkest things will all be essentially black. This is obvious in photos that are \"backlit\" like this one:\n\nThese horses aren't black but because the ratio of the bright light to the dark horses exceeds the dynamic range of the camera the sky is washed out white and the horses are in silhouette.\nYour eye can adjust over time to a huge range but it can't utilize the whole range all at once.\nIn the case of dust reflecting light, if you allow a lot of light into the room the relative brightness between the small amount of light the dust is reflecting and the rest of the illuminated room prevent you from seeing the dust.\n\nThis is fundamental to signal processing. Why can't you hear a whisper in a noisy room?  The noise of the crowd obscures the whisper. The difference between the signal you're trying to pick up and the background noise is called the signal-to-noise ratio. In the case of dust, the light let into the room is scattered and reflected in the room and causes the room to be illuminated.

{"instruction":"How do weather models work?","response":"All numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations derived from primitive equations that describe atmospheric flow. Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships and thereby became the father of numerical weather prediction. Conceptually, the equations can be thought of as describing how a parcel of air would move in relationship to its surroundings. For instance, we learn at a young age that hot air rises. The hydrostatic vertical momentum equation explains why and quantifies under what condictions hot air would stop rising. (As the air rises it expands and cools until it reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.) The other equations consider other types of motion and heat transfer.\n\nUnfortunately, the equations are nonlinear, which means that you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results. Instead, weather models are simulations which divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids and calculate how matter and energy will flow from one cube of space into another during discrete time increments. Actual atmospheric flow is continuous, not discrete, so by necessity the models are approximations. Different models make different approximations appropriate to their specific purpose.\n\nNumerical models have been improving over time for several reasons:\n\n* More and better input data,\n* Tighter grids, and\n* Better approximations.\n\nIncreasing computational power has allowed models to use smaller grid boxes. However, the number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes and the process suffers diminishing returns. On the input end of things, more and better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model. Synoptic scale and mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models, which helps set reasonable intial conditions. On the output end, Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather by comparing the current model state with historical data of times when the model showed similar results. Finally, ensemble models take the output of several models as input and produce a range of possibly outcomes.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Numerical atmospheric models exist.","max_prob":20.0508670807,"ccp":-0.0000373727},{"claim":"Numerical atmospheric models are built around calculations.","max_prob":32.9806289673,"ccp":-0.0000361818},{"claim":"Calculations are derived from primitive equations.","max_prob":22.1483230591,"ccp":-0.0537774659},{"claim":"Primitive equations describe atmospheric flow.","max_prob":13.2828941345,"ccp":-0.4606932414},{"claim":"Vilhelm Bjerknes discovered the relationships.","max_prob":11.9096603394,"ccp":-0.7836327229},{"claim":"Vilhelm Bjerknes became the father of numerical weather prediction.","max_prob":8.8867406845,"ccp":-0.3344126695},{"claim":"We learn at a young age.","max_prob":19.5909976959,"ccp":-0.4941400526},{"claim":"Hot air rises.","max_prob":3.0134341717,"ccp":-0.8762988622},{"claim":"Air rises.","max_prob":1.9948272705,"ccp":-0.4861883832},{"claim":"Air expands as it rises.","max_prob":4.3700628281,"ccp":-0.4861883832},{"claim":"Air cools as it rises.","max_prob":2.2405042648,"ccp":-0.4861753433},{"claim":"Air reaches hydrostatic equilibrium.","max_prob":13.0202741623,"ccp":-0.4406673602},{"claim":"There are other equations.","max_prob":4.8420906067,"ccp":-0.1963900809},{"claim":"The other equations consider other types of motion.","max_prob":20.044801712,"ccp":-0.1273105384},{"claim":"The other equations consider heat transfer.","max_prob":17.5237388611,"ccp":-0.051573049},{"claim":"The equations are nonlinear.","max_prob":4.1772327423,"ccp":-0.6778311202},{"claim":"Nonlinear equations mean you can't simply plug in a few numbers and get useful results.","max_prob":26.8874359131,"ccp":-0.2566059022},{"claim":"Weather models are simulations.","max_prob":12.5533132553,"ccp":-0.0600316595},{"claim":"Weather models divide the atmosphere into three-dimensional grids.","max_prob":15.2279253006,"ccp":-0.0194542384},{"claim":"Weather models calculate how matter will flow from one cube of space into another.","max_prob":37.1395606995,"ccp":-0.0070473135},{"claim":"Weather models calculate how energy will flow from one cube of space into another.","max_prob":28.1833152771,"ccp":-0.0082550962},{"claim":"Weather models perform these calculations during discrete time increments.","max_prob":18.1702156067,"ccp":-0.3746200565},{"claim":"Atmospheric flow is continuous.","max_prob":6.5495443344,"ccp":-0.6086873002},{"claim":"Atmospheric flow is not discrete.","max_prob":9.3061943054,"ccp":-0.0354509404},{"claim":"Models of atmospheric flow are approximations.","max_prob":3.7344558239,"ccp":-0.820306991},{"claim":"Models use grid boxes.","max_prob":8.0011177063,"ccp":-0.0747806344},{"claim":"Increased computational power allows models to use smaller grid boxes.","max_prob":21.3238601685,"ccp":-0.5212085097},{"claim":"The number of computations increases exponentially with the number of boxes.","max_prob":18.6371192932,"ccp":-0.0017457613},{"claim":"The process suffers diminishing returns.","max_prob":24.7977771759,"ccp":-0.0000518205},{"claim":"There are sensors on the input end of things.","max_prob":14.8155956268,"ccp":-0.7674555135},{"claim":"More sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model.","max_prob":20.6385993958,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"Better sensors improve the accuracy of the initial conditions of the model.","max_prob":18.1061973572,"ccp":-0.7139638165},{"claim":"Synoptic scale models take input from General Circulation Models.","max_prob":21.3613796234,"ccp":-0.5841725642},{"claim":"Mesoscale models take input from General Circulation Models.","max_prob":18.918920517,"ccp":-0.3401944552},{"claim":"Model Output Statistics compare the current model state with historical data.","max_prob":27.1198654175,"ccp":-0.0204309573},{"claim":"The historical data consists of times when the model showed similar results.","max_prob":24.0712242126,"ccp":-0.3887195097},{"claim":"Model Output Statistics do a remarkable job of estimating local weather.","max_prob":31.9518089294,"ccp":-0.0568736703},{"claim":"Ensemble models take the output of several models as input.","max_prob":22.5926799774,"ccp":-0.1061835655},{"claim":"Ensemble models produce a range of possible outcomes.","max_prob":22.8794364929,"ccp":-0.1083078729}]}
{"instruction":"I am currently trying to decipher Mazur's Eisenstein ideal paper (not a comment about his clarity, rather about my current abilities). One of the reasons I am doing that is that many people told me that the paper was somehow revolutionary and introduced a new method into number theory. \nCould you explain exactly what subsequent developments did the paper bring, what ideas in the paper were considered more-or-less original (at the time it was published), and exactly what difficulties did these ideas resolve that people failed to resolve before the paper was published (if any)?","response":"First, Mazur's paper is arguably the first paper where the new ideas (and language) of the Grothendieck revolution in algebraic geometry were fully embraced and crucially used in pure number theory.  Here are several notable examples: Mazur makes crucial use of the theory of finite flat group schemes to understand the behavior of the $p$-adic Tate modules of Jacobians at the prime $p$. He studies modular forms of level one over finite rings (which need not lift to characteristic zero when the residue characteristic is $2$ or $3$). He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\n\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\n\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\n\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E\/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why doesn't the nuclear fusion in a star make it explode?","response":"The fusion that occurs in the core of the Sun occurs in nothing like the conditions you might be thinking of in a bomb, or a fusion reactor. In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250\u00a0W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250\u00a0W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion. This is exactly what happens in the core as more hydrogen is turned into helium; the core temperature and luminosity do rise, but slowly, on timescales of billions of years.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I had a Nespresso Vertuo Next machine.  It stopped working properly and during the troubleshooting video call, the Nespresso support agent said that the machines should not be connected to a GFCI outlet because they can potentially damage the machine.  As part of our home inspection when we purchased the house, it was recommended to install such outlets anywhere that water is common, including the kitchen. As such, all the outlets in our kitchen are GFCI outlets.\nThis call with Nespresso was the first time I'd ever seen someone claim that GFCI outlets can potentially damage coffee machines.\nCan they damage Nespresso machines?  If so, can they damage other coffee machines (I also have a Baratza grinder and a Bonavita drip machine I usually hook into the same outlet)?  They sent us a replacement and now I am questioning where to put it.","response":"\n> the Nespresso support agent said that the machines should not be connected to a GFCI outlet\n\nWhere do they think Nespresso machines are used? Bedrooms? No, they're kitchen appliances and GFCIs are widely used in kitchens. GFCIs are code requirements and have been for ~20 years. If they are unable to make a GFCI-compatible machine, then their machine is unfit for purpose, and they have breached their implied warranty. Also, the things use water, for Pete's sake.\n\nThat said, machines do break. On a modern &quot;mass produced, not expected to be repaired&quot; machine, that means it is &quot;at end-of-life&quot;.\n\n> This call with Nespresso was the first time I'd ever seen someone claim that GFCI outlets can potentially damage coffee machines.\n\nLOL no. Such a claim is both nonsensical and inexcusable, and is certainly not coming from their technical department, nor has it been reviewed by their legal team, nor will you ever get them to put that in writing.  Most likely it is because companies put tremendous pressure on customer service agents to have a high rate of good ratings, &quot;close it in 1 call&quot; and &quot;avoid shipping replacement units&quot;. A GFCI-trip call is a worst-case scenario for an agent, and so they're going to say whatever they need to to get a satisfactory 1-call close.  That is about their only option.\n\nIn a rare case, the GFCI might be end-of-life and not be working properly, but that is easily tested by plugging it into the next outlet over that is on a different GFCI, since kitchens generally have 2 independent circuits.\n\nNow, other things can damage a coffee maker. Notably a &quot;Lost Neutral&quot;, where the neutral lead from the power company breaks, causing neutral in the house to wander - the two 120V &quot;halves of the service&quot; still add up to 240V but they are lopsided, with one side higher than 120V. That is particularly hard on resistive heat appliances, since their heat increases by the square of voltage increase.  Lost neutrals can be pernicious and difficult to detect, so it can go weeks or months without being noticed. It's not like service panels have voltmeters on them.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I have extremely bad posture, what can I do?","response":"You can do stretches, strengthening and breathing exercises to improve your posture. But you also have to become aware of your posture and find a way to interrupt prolonged sitting intervals with brief breaks.  A good ergonomic chair is also helpful.\n\n## Musculo-Skeletal Effects of Poor Sitting Posture\n\nPoor sitting posture can create muscle imbalances over time.\n\n* In general, your front stuctures shorten, with muscles like your hip flexors and pectorals tightening up - pulling you into a ball.  Your crunched sitting posture caves your lower ribs down towards your abdomen which prevents the diaphragm from expanding freely. \n* At the same time the muscles of your back stretch out and weaken, especially in the range where they should be working to maintain your posture.\n\nAs this posture persists over time, you joints begin to lose normal range of motion as well making it more difficult to assume a good posture.\n\n\n## Correcting Slumped Sitting Posture\nTailor an exercise program to stretch tightened muscles and strengthen weakened muscles.  Additionally, you need a method to become aware of your posture and correct it while you are sitting.  This is difficult because as you say, your attention is on your work. Exercise programs like Yoga, Tai-Chi and Pilates are good because they all address and make you very aware of your posture, joint alignments, flexibility, core control and breathing.\n\nUse Specific Exercises to Correct Muscle Imbalances:\n\n* Back, Upper Back and Scapular muscles:  Back Extensions strengthen your paraspinals.  Use different arm positions (Y, T, W, L) to target your lower traps, mid traps, rhomboids and scapular stabilizors.  Learn the feel of retracting your scapulas.\nYou can do these on the floor next to your desk. \nOr if you prefer not to get on the floor, use resistance bands for reverse flys, wide rows, narrow rows and rotations. \nAway from work, you can also strengthen these muscles using weights, cables and body weight exercises like inverted rows, cable rows, bent over rows, reverse flys etc.  And squats are a good for strengthening multiple muscles important to posture.\n* Core:  Plank, Side Plank, Bird Dog and Bridge will stabilize your trunk and spine.\n* Stretches: - Hip Flexors, Hamstrings, Abs and Pecs.  The wall pec stretch stretches the pecs but also contracts the rhomboid and trapezius scapular muscles to help improve the positioning of the shoulder and shoulder blade and is easy to do at work. \n* Sitting Posture and Breathing Awareness - This sitting posture exercise helps make you aware of your sitting alignment and expanding your diaphragm.  Practice a few diaphramatic breaths throughout the day along with this sitting exercise to elongate your spine.\n\nCreate your ideal short exercise routine that you can do during short breaks during the day. An exercise ball next to your desk can help you target these muscles in just a few minutes:\n\n* Lie back over the ball and stretch out your front \n* Lie face down over the ball and do the Y, W, T, L exercises.\nAnd consider using the ball as your desk chair for short periods.\n\n## Remembering your Posture throughout the day:\n\nThis is the hard part.  As your muscle imbalances begin to resolve and your diaphragmatic breathing improves, you\u2019ll find that the slouched posture becomes less comfortable and you will automatically begin to sit better.  Until then, use a timed reminder or try tying your posture corrections to tasks that you do at the computer regularly.  For example, correct your posture each time you check your email or some other specific link.  Turn on your web cam for visual reminders.\n\nKeep at it until you feel the improvement.  You'll have less problems going forward if you improve your posture.  It either gets better - or it gets worse.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Increasing your dodge chance (i.e. more power to engines) will help this occur quicker, but even with the default chance you can max out the skill eventually.\n\n###Engines\nExactly as for piloting, a crew member manning the engines gains one point of XP for each projectile evaded while uncloaked in combat - and so it can be trained in the same way.\n\n###Weapons\nA crew member who is manning the weapons station gains one point of experience for each weapon that is fired.  It doesn't matter whether it hits or misses, or whether it can do damage (e.g. a beam weapon fired at a shield).\n(Multi-shot weapons such as burst lasers still count as a single fire order and hence a single XP.)\nThis can be trained by firing non-lethal weapons (e.g. ones that do ion damage) repeatedly against a target that cannot damage you.\n\n###Shields\nA crew member manning the shields station gains one point of experience for each shield \"bubble\" that is brought back up during combat.  It doesn't matter why the shields were down, be that direct enemy fire, ion damage, asteroid strikes, or even manually removing and then restoring power to the shield systems.\nThis can be trained by letting a target that cannot break through all of your shields repeatedly take one layer down. (For fastest results, move your pilot away from the helm, or reduce your engines to 0 power.  This will reduce your dodge chance to 0%, ensuring that everything hits your shields.)\nNote that you used to be able to manually remove power and restore it in combat, to get points, but this has been patched.\n\n###Repair\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the \"finishing blow\" when repairing a (sub)system.  Note that hull breaches provide no repair experience.\nThere's no specific way to train this as it requires your systems to be damaged.  Though you can focus the XP gains by always having the same person run around and repair everything after a battle.\n\n###Combat\nA crew member gains one point of experience for getting the finishing blow when fighting an enemy crew member or (sub)system.\nThis generally gets trained in \"real\" situations.

{"instruction":"How can democracy not be the rule of the poor?","response":"Here are some possible explanations why democracy is not necessarily the rule of the poor:\n\n* Voters voting by habit, not by analysis. Many people vote the same way their parents voted. Other vote exactly the opposite way. Neither involves analysis of their objective economic interest.\n* A middle class believing to be rich, a lower middle class believing to be middle class. In many countries, voters tend to vote in the interest of the class they aspire to be, not in the interest of the class they actually are. Part of that is self-deception about inequality and the own position. That is visible in tax policy, for instance, where the middle class votes against taxes on the upper class.\n* An upper class better able to work the political system than the poor. In some countries, attempts to simplify the access to the political system (e.g. through direct democracy or participatory budgeting) have backfired when it comes to the poor. These mechanisms remain complicated enough that it takes some familiarity with the political system to get anything done. Knowing how to organize a grassroots movement, how to write minutes of a meeting, how to collect signatures for a ballot initiative. So instead of better welfare in poor parts of town, there are better playgrounds in rich parts of town.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

That means that it runs a piece of Javascript until it returns control back to the interpreter.  Then, only when it returns back to the interpreter, Javascript gets the next event from the event queue and runs it.\nAll things like timers and network events run through the event queue.  So, when a timer fires or a network request arrives, it does not ever \"interrupt\" the currently running Javascript.  Instead, an event gets put in the Javascript event queue and then, when the currently running Javascript finishes, the next event is pulled from the event queue and it gets its turn to run.\nSo, when you do an infinite loop such as ```while(flag==false) {}```, the currently running Javascript never finishes and thus the next event is never pulled from the event queue and thus the value of ```flag``` never gets changed.  They key here is that Javascript is not interrupt driven.  When a timer fires, it does not interrupt the currently running Javascript, run some other Javascript and then let the currently running Javascript continue.  It just gets put in the event queue waiting until the currently running Javascript is done to get its turn to run.\n\nWhat you need to do is rethink how your code works and find a different way to trigger whatever code you want to run when the ```flag``` value changes.  Javascript is designed as an event-driven language.  So, what you need to do is figure out what events you can register an interest in so you can either listen for the event that might cause the flag to change and you can examine the flag on that event or you can trigger your own event from whatever code might change the flag or you can implement a callback function that whatever code changes that flag can call your callback whenever the piece of code responsible for changing the flag value would change it's value to ```true```, it just calls the callback function and thus your code that wants to run when the flag gets set to ```true``` will get to run at the right time.  This is much, much more efficient than trying to use some sort of timer to constantly check the flag value.\n```function codeThatMightChangeFlag(callback) {\n    \/\/ do a bunch of stuff\n    if (condition happens to change flag value) {\n        \/\/ call the callback to notify other code\n        callback();\n    }\n}\n```","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Otherwise, your options are (A) choose the major isoform (if it's known in your tissue and condition) or (B) use a \"union gene model\" (sum the non-redundant exon lengths) or (C) take the median transcript length. None of those three options make much of a difference if you're comparing between samples, though they're all inferior to a salmon\/kallisto\/etc. metric.\n\nWhy are salmon et al. better methods? They don't use arbitrary metrics that will be the same across samples to determine the feature length. Instead, they use expectation maximization (or similarish, since at least salmon doesn't actually use EM) to quantify individual isoform usage. The effective gene length in a sample is then the average of the transcript lengths after weighting for their relative expression (yes, one should remove $\\mu$ in there). This can then vary between samples, which is quite useful if you have isoform switching between samples\/groups in such a way that methods A-C above would miss (think of cases where the switch is to a smaller transcript with higher coverage over it...resulting in the coverage\/length in methods A-C to be tamped down).","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What is the significance of 1\/1\/1753 in SQL Server?","response":"The decision to use 1st January 1753 (```1753-01-01```) as the minimum date value for a datetime in SQL Server goes back to its Sybase origins.\nThe significance of the date itself though can be attributed to this man.\n\nPhilip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. Who steered the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 through the British Parliament. This legislated for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar for Britain and its then colonies. \n\nThere were some missing days (internet archive link) in the British calendar in 1752 when the adjustment was finally made from the Julian calendar. September 3, 1752 to September 13, 1752 were lost.\nKalen Delaney explained the choice this way\n\n> So, with 12 days lost, how can you compute dates? For example, how can you compute the number of days between October 12, 1492, and July 4, 1776? Do you include those missing 12 days? To avoid having to solve this problem, the original Sybase SQL Server developers decided not to allow dates before 1753. You can store earlier dates by using character fields, but you can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.\n\nThe choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric however as many catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation (originally delayed due to opposition by the church). Conversely many countries did not reform their calendars until much later, 1918 in Russia. Indeed the October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.\nBoth ```datetime``` and the new ```datetime2``` datatype mentioned in Joe's answer do not attempt to account for these local differences and simply use the Gregorian Calendar.\nSo with the greater range of ```datetime2```\n```SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DATEADD(DAY,-5,CAST('1752-09-13' AS DATETIME2)),100)\n```\nReturns\n```Sep  8 1752 12:00AM\n```\nOne final point with the ```datetime2``` data type is that it uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar projected backwards to well before it was actually invented so is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.\nThis contrasts with other Software implementations such as the Java Gregorian Calendar class which defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582 then jumping to October 15, 1582 in the new Gregorian calendar. It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date and the Gregorian model after that date. The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling ```setGregorianChange()```. \nA fairly entertaining article discussing some more peculiarities with the adoption of the calendar can be found here.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"SQL Server uses 1st January 1753 (```1753-01-01```) as the minimum date value for a datetime.","max_prob":44.2959213257,"ccp":-0.1461436698},{"claim":"Britain adopted the Gregorian calendar.","max_prob":8.242855072,"ccp":-0.9111687949},{"claim":"Britain's then colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar.","max_prob":14.1202068329,"ccp":-0.9111687949},{"claim":"There were some missing days in the British calendar in 1752.","max_prob":29.1777591705,"ccp":-0.1344130408},{"claim":"The adjustment involved the British calendar.","max_prob":7.135330677,"ccp":-0.0883210952},{"claim":"The adjustment was finally made in 1752.","max_prob":10.0019292831,"ccp":-0.7958247638},{"claim":"The original Sybase SQL Server developers made a decision.","max_prob":16.4540042877,"ccp":-0.0119670107},{"claim":"The decision was to not allow dates before 1753.","max_prob":7.7421140671,"ccp":-0.2911243284},{"claim":"The decision was made to avoid having to solve a certain problem.","max_prob":12.109290123,"ccp":-0.1968276763},{"claim":"You can store earlier dates by using character fields.","max_prob":20.9920845032,"ccp":-0.0251791668},{"claim":"You can't use any datetime functions with the earlier dates that you store in character fields.","max_prob":25.2709369659,"ccp":-0.217677092},{"claim":"The choice of 1753 does seem somewhat anglocentric.","max_prob":32.9314804077,"ccp":-0.1675783202},{"claim":"Many Catholic countries in Europe had been using the calendar for 170 years before the British implementation.","max_prob":39.239440918,"ccp":-0.0120511448},{"claim":"The British implementation of the calendar was originally delayed due to opposition by the church.","max_prob":34.0514717102,"ccp":-0.09440163},{"claim":"Many countries did not reform their calendars until much later.","max_prob":19.6417732239,"ccp":-0.5089500729},{"claim":"Russia reformed its calendar in 1918.","max_prob":5.5357942581,"ccp":-0.026705963},{"claim":"The October Revolution of 1917 started on 7 November under the Gregorian calendar.","max_prob":28.3667297363,"ccp":-0.0001101289},{"claim":"The `datetime` datatype does not attempt to account for local differences.","max_prob":40.6043014526,"ccp":-0.0015640049},{"claim":"The `datetime` datatype uses the Gregorian Calendar.","max_prob":21.6206169128,"ccp":-0.0045751448},{"claim":"The `datetime2` datatype does not attempt to account for local differences.","max_prob":30.7823200226,"ccp":-0.1928555428},{"claim":"The `datetime2` datatype uses the Gregorian Calendar.","max_prob":11.7986354828,"ccp":-0.5138932008},{"claim":"The `datetime2` datatype is mentioned in Joe's answer.","max_prob":25.3033027649,"ccp":-0.1713862211},{"claim":"The `datetime2` data type has a greater range than some other data types.","max_prob":22.0443496704,"ccp":-0.9980206298},{"claim":"The SQL query uses the `CONVERT` function to change a date to a `VARCHAR` format.","max_prob":6.0167908669,"ccp":-0.0637051701},{"claim":"The SQL query uses the `DATEADD` function to subtract 5 days from a given date.","max_prob":12.4820232391,"ccp":-0.0002319932},{"claim":"The given date in the SQL query is '1752-09-13'.","max_prob":6.0447101593,"ccp":-0.0055409983},{"claim":"The given date is cast to the `DATETIME2` data type.","max_prob":9.6897745132,"ccp":-0.002647328},{"claim":"The result of the SQL query is 'Sep  8 1752 12:00AM'.","max_prob":9.7932958603,"ccp":-0.0232763376},{"claim":"The `datetime2` data type uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar.","max_prob":17.1387138367,"ccp":-0.2114275817},{"claim":"The proleptic Gregorian calendar is projected backwards to well before it was actually invented.","max_prob":43.6268692017,"ccp":-0.002582877},{"claim":"The `datetime2` data type is of limited use in dealing with historic dates.","max_prob":21.2326087952,"ccp":-0.0587403927},{"claim":"The Java Gregorian Calendar class is a software implementation.","max_prob":26.7391891479,"ccp":-0.0000111272},{"claim":"The Java Gregorian Calendar class defaults to following the Julian Calendar for dates until October 4, 1582.","max_prob":39.8636322021,"ccp":-0.0387533548},{"claim":"The Java Gregorian Calendar class jumps to October 15, 1582, in the new Gregorian calendar after October 4, 1582.","max_prob":29.7719936371,"ccp":-0.0449531464},{"claim":"It correctly handles the Julian model of leap year before that date.","max_prob":35.3839530945,"ccp":-0.798146649},{"claim":"The cutover date may be changed.","max_prob":17.4824981689,"ccp":-0.0002315583},{"claim":"The caller can change the cutover date.","max_prob":23.9636211395,"ccp":-0.0001825641},{"claim":"The caller can change the cutover date by calling `setGregorianChange()`.","max_prob":26.5409469604,"ccp":-0.0000844506}]}

This won't affect the maximum speed of your connection, but it would cause some latency. pjc50 points out that it's about a nanosecond for every foot of cable length, which is a good rule of thumb used by many engineers when developing systems which are very dependent on latencies on those timescales.\n\nIn reality, you will never notice a difference. A \"fast\" ping time on the Internet is 10&nbsp;ms, which is 10,000,000&nbsp;ns. Adding even a few hundred feet of cable isn't going to have a noticeable effect at that point. In fact, nearly every step of the way involves delays which are more extreme than those seen from signal propagation.

{"instruction":"What does ```class``` do in Ruby?","response":"First, the ```class``` syntax opens up ```foo```'s singleton class (eigenclass). This allows you to specialise the behaviour of methods called on that specific object.\n```a = 'foo'\nclass << a\n  def inspect\n    '\"bar\"'\n  end\nend\na.inspect   # => \"bar\"\na = 'foo'   # new object, new singleton class\na.inspect   # => \"foo\"\n```\n\nNow, to answer the question: ```class``` opens up ```self```'s singleton class, so that methods can be redefined for the current ```self``` object (which inside a class or module body is the class or module itself). Usually, this is used to define class\/module (\"static\") methods:\n```class String\n  class << self\n    def value_of obj\n      obj.to_s\n    end\n  end\nend\nString.value_of 42   # => \"42\"\n```\nThis can also be written as a shorthand:\n```class String\n  def self.value_of obj\n    obj.to_s\n  end\nend\n```\nOr even shorter:\n```def String.value_of obj\n  obj.to_s\nend\n```\n\nWhen inside a function definition, ```self``` refers to the object the function is being called with. In this case, ```class``` opens the singleton class for that object; one use of that is to implement a poor man's state machine:\n```class StateMachineExample\n  def process obj\n    process_hook obj\n  end\nprivate\n  def process_state_1 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_2\n    end\n  end\n  def process_state_2 obj\n    # ...\n    class << self\n      alias process_hook process_state_1\n    end\n  end\n  # Set up initial state\n  alias process_hook process_state_1\nend\n```\nSo, in the example above, each instance of ```StateMachineExample``` has ```process_hook``` aliased to ```process_state_1```, but note how in the latter, it can redefine ```process_hook``` (for ```self``` only, not affecting other ```StateMachineExample``` instances) to ```process_state_2```. So, each time a caller calls the ```process``` method (which calls the redefinable ```process_hook```), the behaviour changes depending on what state it's in.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why is digital photography so expensive?","response":"Digital photography is not expensive but buying into it is.\n\nWith film photography camera and lenses were a moderate investment but these lasted quite long. Even a battery in a film camera would last several years. Cameras and lenses were mechanical and much simpler than today's models. This made them require less expertise to manufacture and also made them incredibly sturdy. A lifespan of a decade for a camera and several decades for lenses was not uncommon.\n\nHowever, the real cost of film photography is film and development. Each roll of film costs several dollars and gives up to 36 images. Specialized rolls were more expensive and had fewer exposures. Then, if you did not do development yourself, you had to pay for development. Also prints. Even if you did your own, chemicals and papers were recurring costs. And there was the added expensive of creating a wet darkroom. In the end, the hobby was quite costly.\n\nWith digital photography, you pay nearly all costs up-front and it comes out much cheaper for anyone who is into the art and shoots regularly. A mid-range DSLR with good lens and memory can easily be obtained for less than $2500. Many entry level ones exist for under $1000. If you were to shoot 10,000 frames before both your camera and lens dies, it would cost you between 2.5&cent; to 10&cent; per frame. It is far far less than even just the film for each frame. Still most cameras have shutters rated to at least 100,000 frames and lenses last much longer than cameras. Even if you only captured 1000 images, you would have a better deal than with film photography. All digital cameras come with rechargeable batteries, good for 500-1000 shots-per-charge (for DSLRs) and can be charged at least 50-100 times before needing to be replaced. That means you actually will not use up the battery before you have taken full advantage of the better value of digital photography.\n\nMarket conditions are forcing the price of digital photography to increase. The loss of market share of compact and ultra-compact digital cameras to cellphones forced manufacturers to discontinue such products and concentrate on higher-end offering. While the number of unit sales of digital cameras has been declining, the average price is going up to compensate for reduced revenue.

The zeroth\/first entry in this array corresponds to ```&``` in the replacement pattern of ```sed```'s substitution command (or ```$&``` in Perl), which is the bit of the string that matches the pattern, while the entries at index 1 and onwards corresponds to ```\\1```, ```\\2```, etc. in a ```sed``` replacement pattern (or ```$1```, ```$2``` etc. in Perl), i.e. the bits matched by each parenthesis.\n\nExample:\n```string=$( date +%T )\nif [[ \"$string\" =~ ^([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9])$ ]]; then\n  printf 'Got %s, %s and %s\\n' \\\n    \"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\" \"${BASH_REMATCH[2]}\" \"${BASH_REMATCH[3]}\"\nfi\n```\nThis may output\n```Got 09, 19 and 14\n```\nif the current time happens to be 09:19:14.\nThe ```REMATCH``` bit of the ```BASH_REMATCH``` array name comes from \"Regular Expression Match\", i.e. \"RE-Match\".\n\nIn non-```bash``` Bourne-like shells, one may also use ```expr``` for limited regular expression matching (using only basic regular expressions).\nA small example:\n```$ string=\"hello 123 world\"\n$ expr \"$string\" : \".*[^0-9]\\([0-9][0-9]*\\)\"\n123\n```","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}

This variable exists only when a shell function is executing. Assignments to FUNCNAME have no effect and return an error status. If FUNCNAME is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\nThis variable can be used with BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE. Each element of FUNCNAME has corresponding elements in BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE to describe the call stack.

Is this officially tolerated, or would I endanger the hosts or other participants by asking about them?","response":"Essentially, there is no religious freedom in Saudi Arabia, and nobody is likely to openly change - indeed:\n\n> conversion from Islam to another religion is considered apostasy and punishable by death.\n\nAll citizens are considered Muslim by the state.\nIn 2008, the Vatican tried to get a Catholic Church built in Saudi Arabia, and had discussions with the Saudi government, but the result was that it was not permitted.\nSo that brings us to the Christians (including Catholics) that DO exist in the country.  There are considered to be more than a million Roman Catholics in the country, as well as from many others.\n\n> Saudi Arabia allows Christians to enter the country as foreign workers for temporary work, but does not allow them to practice their faith openly. Because of that Christians generally only worship in secret within private homes. Items and articles belonging to religions other than Islam are prohibited. These include Bibles, crucifixes, statues, carvings, items with religious symbols, and others.\n\nSo, to your question about whether this secret practice is allowed or tolerated? Not so much. They have an entire 'government' organisation - The Saudi Arabian Mutaween (Arabic: \u0645\u0637\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0646), or Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (i.e., the religious police) which prohibits the practice of any religion other than Islam.\nThe government also doesn't let clergy of other religions into the country for conducting religious services (naturally this means no Christian baptisms, weddings etc by official clergy legally).\nAnd if they find someone practising in their homes? International Christian Concern (ICC) protested what it reported as the 2001 detention of 11 Christians in Saudi Arabia, for practicing their religion in their homes. In June 2004, ICC reported on what it termed a \"pogrom-like\" crackdown by Saudi police on Christians after media reports of Koran desecration in Guantanamo Bay.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

The rules state:\n\nBidding may start at any price.\n\nMonopoly auctions do not have &quot;the bidding will start at $10&quot;.  They just have &quot;bidding is open&quot;.

I am then given another ciphertext that I should decrypt.\nI know that XOR-ing two ciphers gives me the XOR of their original messages.\nMy question is what is the correct thing to do after that?\nI tried to take 3 ciphertexts $C_1, C_2$ and $C_3$.\nThen get $S_1 = C_1 \\oplus C_2  \\oplus $```' '```, also get $S_2 = C_1 \\oplus C_3 \\oplus$ ```' '```.\nAfter that I compared all corresponding characters in $S_1$ and $S_2$,\nand if $S_1[i] = S_2[i]$ then I calculate $S_1[i] \\oplus C_2[i]$ to get $K[i]$.\nI tried this on paper before coding and it worked, but I might be missing something.\nIs this the right approach? Why does it work?","response":"The classical answer to \"what is the correct thing to do after you have the XOR of the two original messages\" is crib-dragging.\n\nThat is, you take a guess of a common phrase that may appear in one of the plaintexts (the classical example against ASCII english is the 5 letter \" the \"), and exclusive-or that against the XOR of the two original messages in various locations.  If one of the plaintexts had the text of the crib (\" the \" in our example), then the result of the exclusive-or is what the other plaintext had in that position; if neither plaintext had that, it's likely that the result of the exclusive-or is just gibberish.  And, once you have a plausible short section, you can extend it (for example, if you know that one of the plaintexts is \" na**\", you can go through the dictionary of all words that start with \"na\", use those as cribs, and see which makes the other plaintext make sense).\n\nIn addition, you can often deduce things directly from the bit pattern.  For example, if the messages are in ASCII, then one thing to note that bit 6 of letters is set, but bit 6 of spaces, numbers and (most) punctuation is clear; because spaces are far more common than numbers and punctuation, then that will give you a good guess of where spaces occur in the texts (albeit without telling you which message a specific space appears in).\n\nNow, if you have 11 messages all encrypted with the same pad (an \"11-time pad\"), things get even easier.  Obviously, you can grab a crib across one message, and check it against the other 10; if it makes all 10 make sense, then it is almost certainly accurate.  Even better, by using the observation that you can distinguish spaces from letters (again, by comparing bit 6), you can find where all the spaces appear in the messages; these all act like 1 character cribs, probably revealing virtually all the text of all the messages.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

So change all the passwords. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 random (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.\n\nIf the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.\n\nThe second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device. Connections should always go through a gateway that itself requires authentication to cross, and that you keep patched with any security updates.\n\nYou should also apply security updates on all the device if they exist at all, which can be a problem.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What are objective advantages or disadvantages of using the markup language LaTeX instead of a WYSIWYG word processor like MS Word or LibreOffice Writer?\nPlease use objective arguments.","response":"LaTeX is better at:\n\n* Dealing with mathematical notation. Layout and entry are generally easier using LaTeX than some other sort of equation editor. \n* Consistent handling of intra-document references and bibliography. As of a couple of years ago the major WYSIWYG editors still had problems with re-numbering cross-references and bibliography items. This is never a problem with BibTeX or LaTeX. \n* Separation of content and style. In principle this means that you can write your document without caring how it is formatted, and at the end of the day wrap it in the style-file provided by the journal publisher before submission to conform to the house style. In practice some of the journal publishers demand special formatting commands that partially moots this process. Furthermore recent versions of Word and LibreOffice Writer, when properly used, should be able to keep track of various levels of section heading separate from the body text, and apply uniform styling to each level. The gap is somewhat closing. \n* Tables and illustrations. With PSTricks or TikZ, one can produce high quality illustrations within the document (though the learning curve is a bit steep there). And I've found LaTeX to be better at preparing complex tables. \n\nWYSIWYG (especially Word and Writer) is better at:\n\n* Collaborative editing. Without using an online site for collaborative LaTeX editing (such as ShareLaTeX), working collaboratively on a LaTeX file ideally requires some sort of separate revision control software. Word and Writer have very good comments\/annotations and edit-tracking features. When a large number of authors are commenting on the writing of one file, this can be very useful. \n* Spell check. Admittedly most text editors one uses to edit TeX files also do spell check. But this is generally conveniently built into WYSIWYG editors. \n* Compatibility. Unless you work in mathematics, computer science, or physics (and sometimes even if you work in those fields), it is more likely that your collaborators will know what to do with a Word or Writer file than a LaTeX file. \n* Minimum barrier to entry. If you just care about getting the ideas down on paper, you can use a WYSIWYG editor just like a typewriter. Sure, it may be tedious to fix the formatting later on, compared to LaTeX where one need to first figure out how to setup a bare-minimum file before using, it may be an attractive point. \n\nA wash:\n\n* Most journals provide templates for both Word and LaTeX, so there's no real winner there. \n\nSuggestion: if you want to convince someone to start using LaTeX, start them out first in one of the WYSIWYG environments designed for LaTeX first (for example LyX). This will help somewhat to ameliorate the scary entry barrier.

{"instruction":"Could Gandalf not have made his own One Ring?","response":"Possibly\nIn the foreword to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien observes:\n\nSaruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien therefore definitely conceives of Saruman as being capable of making a Ring, and therefore Gandalf would presumably have been likewise capable.\nHowever, what we can also take from that statement is that making a Ring is not a simple task; there is some &quot;lore&quot; involved, and we know from elsewhere that Saruman had made especial study of the Rings of Power, but yet Tolkien states that even he would have required knowledge found only in Mordor to complete his own work.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n* Yes, but,\n* It's neither quick nor easy, because,\n* There is considerable &quot;lore&quot; involved, and,\n* It requires hundreds or even thousands of years of dedicated study to get to a &quot;Saruman-level&quot; of &quot;lore&quot;, and,\n* Even then there will be missing knowledge which may only be found in Mordor.\n* So for all practical purposes it's actually &quot;No&quot;.\n","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"When would one use an impact driver versus a regular drill?","response":"Drills and impact drivers are similar in that they're both rotating power tools and they have some overlap in usage, but they work differently and have different strengths.\n\nDrills apply a constant torque and tend to have good control across a range of speeds and clutch settings. They're good for work that requires care or precision, like drilling a hole or driving a a smaller screw.\n\nImpact drivers provide much higher torque but in rapid bursts\u2013very much like a hammer provides bursts of linear force. \n\nThis makes them good for heavy-duty jobs like driving long lag bolts (you can even take the lug nuts off your car wheels with most impact drivers), but the banging action makes them a little bit difficult to control. They're also not good for driving into something very soft\u2013between the hammer strikes there's no torque applied and the bit can actually rotate backwards. You can see this by holding the chuck with your hands while the driver is on; you'll feel the pulsing of the strikes but chuck won't actually rotate. Finally, some impact drivers don't have a clutch, which means you need to be very careful if you're driving something that could be over-tightened or broken by the high torque.\n\nBesides the higher torque, impact drivers have another huge advantage in that you don't have to hold them tightly to provide the torque. The momentum of the rotating striker inside is what provides the rotation force, so even when you're driving something very tough it's quite easy to hold the tool. Drills on the other hand provide a constant torque and require the user to provide the reaction and prevent the tool from spinning.\n\nIf you have to pick a single all-purpose tool for general DIY use, a drill is much easier to control and is useful in a wider range of situations.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Drills and impact drivers are both rotating power tools.","max_prob":25.7527942657,"ccp":-0.0689095013},{"claim":"Drills and impact drivers have some overlap in usage.","max_prob":33.6285705566,"ccp":-0.091619708},{"claim":"Drills and impact drivers work differently.","max_prob":23.9663219452,"ccp":-0.0323095596},{"claim":"Drills and impact drivers have different strengths.","max_prob":23.2994499207,"ccp":-0.091619708},{"claim":"Drills apply a constant torque.","max_prob":14.0598831177,"ccp":-0.1183104008},{"claim":"Drills tend to have good control across a range of speeds.","max_prob":31.6923866272,"ccp":-0.3200624238},{"claim":"Drills tend to have good control across a range of clutch settings.","max_prob":38.8101730347,"ccp":-0.3200624238},{"claim":"They are good for work that requires care.","max_prob":19.4094429016,"ccp":-0.9068023961},{"claim":"They are good for work that requires precision.","max_prob":11.4888057709,"ccp":-0.9570518496},{"claim":"Drilling a hole requires care or precision.","max_prob":16.8406829834,"ccp":-0.6558966516},{"claim":"Driving a smaller screw requires care or precision.","max_prob":21.0681343079,"ccp":-0.6338831771},{"claim":"Impact drivers provide much higher torque.","max_prob":9.7388219833,"ccp":-0.8441794044},{"claim":"Impact drivers provide torque in rapid bursts.","max_prob":13.6232690811,"ccp":-0.8133956837},{"claim":"A hammer provides bursts of linear force.","max_prob":23.2610187531,"ccp":-0.5049914005},{"claim":"Impact drivers are good for heavy-duty jobs.","max_prob":9.8532781601,"ccp":-0.7337461507},{"claim":"You can take the lug nuts off your car wheels with most impact drivers.","max_prob":32.1625747681,"ccp":-0.0000915616},{"claim":"The banging action of impact drivers makes them a little bit difficult to control.","max_prob":26.677936554,"ccp":-0.0164538767},{"claim":"They're not good for driving into something very soft.","max_prob":21.7674064636,"ccp":-0.1126681488},{"claim":"Between the hammer strikes, there's no torque applied.","max_prob":29.9869689941,"ccp":-0.001040431},{"claim":"The bit can actually rotate backwards.","max_prob":15.1292705536,"ccp":-0.0956644074},{"claim":"You can hold the chuck with your hands.","max_prob":13.7644052505,"ccp":-0.0308152244},{"claim":"The driver is on.","max_prob":5.278512001,"ccp":-0.4833249936},{"claim":"You will feel the pulsing of the strikes.","max_prob":17.864282608,"ccp":-0.1198990738},{"claim":"The chuck won't actually rotate.","max_prob":8.0887336731,"ccp":-0.3816172422},{"claim":"Some impact drivers don't have a clutch.","max_prob":8.3614025116,"ccp":-0.3222119487},{"claim":"If an impact driver doesn't have a clutch, you need to be very careful.","max_prob":15.0109348297,"ccp":-0.3222119487},{"claim":"You need to be careful if you're driving something that could be over-tightened by high torque.","max_prob":40.1780319214,"ccp":-0.1337744392},{"claim":"You need to be careful if you're driving something that could be broken by high torque.","max_prob":32.8392982483,"ccp":-0.3647397153},{"claim":"Impact drivers have higher torque.","max_prob":16.5595474243,"ccp":-0.7486862173},{"claim":"You don't have to hold impact drivers tightly to provide the torque.","max_prob":24.8505325317,"ccp":-0.2320207412},{"claim":"The momentum of the rotating striker inside provides the rotation force.","max_prob":30.5471611023,"ccp":-0.0334498996},{"claim":"It is quite easy to hold the tool even when driving something very tough.","max_prob":30.5499305725,"ccp":-0.244902042},{"claim":"Drills provide a constant torque.","max_prob":8.2062702179,"ccp":-0.2791301987},{"claim":"Drills require the user to provide the reaction.","max_prob":16.3392028809,"ccp":-0.0860803717},{"claim":"Drills require the user to prevent the tool from spinning.","max_prob":15.4104785919,"ccp":-0.2262232545},{"claim":"A drill is easier to control than other tools for general DIY use.","max_prob":13.5602741241,"ccp":-0.0368931063}]}

{"instruction":"What is the difference between kerning vs. letter spacing?","response":"Any font has built-in spacing determined by the \u201cside bearing\u201d of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* \u201cTo kern\u201d means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly \u201cglyphs\u201d) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often \u201ctracking\u201d in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading.

{"instruction":"I read somewhere that C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ 41 by cents from each other. As far as I know, there should be 2 semitones between C and D. Moreover, C\u266f is one semitone above C and D\u266d is one semitone below D. Therefore, C\u266f and D\u266d should be equivalent. If so, how can C\u266f and D\u266d actually differ by 41 cents from each other?","response":"When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note.\n\n12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C\u266f and D\u266d in, say, \"Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz\".\n\nBut most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C\u266f to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F\u266f minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp.\n\nWhen people say that C\u266f is not the same as D\u266d, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C\u266f might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D\u266d might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"When reading some documentation about the security of a product, I found that the vendor uses the SHA-2 of a password to encrypt data (AES-256), instead of using this password directly.\nAre there any advantages of doing so?\nAn attacker is not going to crack the encrypted data using this SHA-2-as-a-password key but rather exhaust the password keyspace (if feasible) and try its hash. Therefore the only reason I can think of is that there is an extra computational step (the creation of the hash). I would have rather increased the password entropy if the point is to computationally complexify the attack.","response":"It sounds like a primitive version of a key derivation function (KDF), in particular they probably could have avoided reinventing the wheel by using PBKDF2.\n\nThere are several reasons why you don't want to use the password directly as an AES key. \n\n* To distribute the bits. The main property here is that a hash function's output is, statistically speaking, uniformly distributed. People tend to pick passwords that aren't fully random, in particular, most passwords would only contain characters you can type in a keyboard. When used as an encryption key, a non-statistically random key may expose weaknesses in the encryption function.\n* To fit the keys to the encryption key length. Most passwords are going to be either longer or shorter than the key space of the encryption function. By hashing your password, the exact key length will be exactly the size of the input key of your encryption function. While the entropy of the derived key doesn't increase, this avoids the likelihood of exposing weakness in the encryption function if you just simply zero pad the password or worse truncate the password.\n* To slow down key derivation decryption. Per your description, the software is only using a single SHA256 round, which is not much. But with proper password based KDF, like PBKDF2, there are usually tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rounds of the underlying hash function. This slows down computing the keys, increasing the effective strength of passwords without increasing its length.\n* To keep the user's plain text password out of memory, thus preventing it from being accidentally dumped to disk during hibernation or crash dump. While this wouldn't protect the hash from being used to decrypt the data you're encrypting, it will prevent the password from being reused to decrypt other files (which presumably uses different salt) or being tried on your online accounts or other devices that you use.\n","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Any thoughts?","response":"As serialization doesn't work generally (only when the order of properties matches: ```JSON.stringify({a:1,b:2}) !== JSON.stringify({b:2,a:1})```) you have to check the count of properties and compare each property as well:\n\n```const objectsEqual = (o1, o2) =>\n    Object.keys(o1).length === Object.keys(o2).length\n        && Object.keys(o1).every(p => o1[p] === o2[p]);\nconst obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 33};\nconst obj2 = { age: 33, name: 'John' };\nconst obj3 = { name: 'John', age: 45 };\nconsole.log(objectsEqual(obj1, obj2)); \/\/ true\nconsole.log(objectsEqual(obj1, obj3)); \/\/ false```\n\nIf you need a deep comparison, you can call the function recursively:\n\n```const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 33, info: { married: true, hobbies: ['sport', 'art'] } };\nconst obj2 = { age: 33, name: 'John', info: { hobbies: ['sport', 'art'], married: true } };\nconst obj3 = { name: 'John', age: 33 };\nconst objectsEqual = (o1, o2) =>\n    typeof o1 === 'object' && Object.keys(o1).length > 0\n        ?

A ```pull``` effectively runs ```git fetch``` and then ```git merge``` so a merge is usually happening when you run ```git pull```.\n\nThe alternative to use rebasing instead of merging is possible, but usually you should avoid it. Rebasing allows you to keep a linear history, but also removes any information about the branching that originally happened. It will also cause the history of the current branch being rewritten, recreating all commits that are not contained in the target branch (in your case, the remote). As the recreated commits are different commits, this can cause a lot of confusion when developing together with others, especially when people already checked out parts of those commits before they get rewritten (for example with feature branches). So as a rule of thumb, you should never rewrite any commit that was already pushed.\n\nThe commits you see are there to combine two (or more) branches. It is perfectly fine to have a commit that does nothing else then merging multiple branches. In fact it makes it very clear when you have a merge commit that combines branches when looking at the history. In comparison to rebasing, merging also allows you to effectively see the original history as it was developed, including the actual branches that coexisted.\n\nSo, long story short: Yes, having merge commits is perfectly fine and you should not worry about them.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"You are asleep on your boat on open sea. When you wake up you discover you have been robbed. A quick inspection of security cam footage reveals that the pirates who robbed you left your ship exactly an hour ago. The sea is flat, extends indefinitely, and is fully covered in a thick persistent fog. You have no idea in which direction the pirates fled. But you do know that these pirates always continue in a straight line at full speed away from their victim. Their maximum speed on open water is 20 nautical miles per hour. Your boat can reach 21 nautical miles per hour. \nHow do you catch the pirates?","response":"If we assume the ocean is flat and extends indefinitely in all directions, there is a strategy that guarantees we can catch the pirates in at most 800,000 years.\n\nPut our current location as the origin of a coordinate system. We will describe our position in polar coordinates, as a function of time: $(r(t),\\theta(t))$ (where we have arbitrarily chosen a direction to be $\\theta=0$, and $t=0$ is when we realized we had been robbed).\n\nWe begin by traveling in the $\\theta=0$ direction for 20 hours, putting our position at $(420, 0)$. We are then the same distance from the origin as the pirates. Next, we will travel in a spiral, in a manner so that $r'(t)=20$ at all times. This guarantees we will always be the same distance from the origin as the pirates. For $t\\geq 20$, we will have $r(t)=420+20(t-20)=20t+20$.\n\nOur speed is\n$$\n\\sqrt{(r')^2+r^2(\\theta')^2} = 21\\text{ mph},\n$$\nand $r'(t)=20$ for $t>20$, so\n$$\n\\theta'(t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{41}{r^2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{20+20t}.\n$$\nIf there is a $t\\geq 20$ for which $\\theta(t)$ is the angle in which the pirates fled, we will catch them. This means we will certainly catch the pirates by the time $\\theta$ has increased from $0$ to $2\\pi$. If $t_0$ is the time this happens, we have\n$$\n2\\pi=\\int_{20}^{t_0}\\theta'(t)\\,dt=\\int_{20}^{t_0}\\frac{\\sqrt{41}}{20+20t}dt.\n$$\nSolving for $t_0$ gives\n$$\nt_0=21\\mathrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{40\\pi}{\\sqrt{41}}\\right)-1\\approx 7,005,043,026.\n$$\nThis means we can catch the pirates in at most 7,005,043,026 hours, or about 800 millennia.

{"instruction":"I heard north ridge of mount Stuart from my friends, can you tell me more?","response":"Sure thing! This iconic North American climb is a 1200 ft (364 m) multi-pitch alpine trad route with 18 pitches, rated as Grade III. It is a famous alpine rock route, not just in Washington, but nationally. First ascended by John Rupley & Don Gordon (1956) [Great Gendarme] and James Wickwire & Fred Stanley (1964), it's a must-do for alpine rock enthusiasts.\n\nRoute Overview:\nFrom the Stuart Glacier notch, approximately 11 pitches of low\/mid 5th class climbing lead to the Gendarme's base. Despite the enjoyable exposed climbing, the Gendarme features the most remarkable pitches. Two crux 5.9 pitches await, with the first being a steep dihedral offering good rests between challenging sections. Traverse to the offwidth, power through it, and tackle one more 5.8-5.9 pitch before the final three pitches of low 5th.\n\nEquipment:\nGear preferences vary. Carry your usual equipment for long alpine rock routes. If you want extra security in the cruxy 5.9 offwidth, carry one 3.5\" piece. You may need an ice axe and crampons if you approach via the glacier. \n\nGetting there:\nDrive I-90 to exit 85, turn left to join SR-970. Drive 6.6 mi and turn left on Teanaway River Road. Follow north fork road approximately 23 mil to the end of road.\n\nApproach and Descends:\nMultiple approach options exist, each with pros and cons. Either approach from the south via Longs Pass TH or from the north via Mountaineer Creek. Acquire a topographic map to determine the best route. If approaching from LPTH, head to Ingalls Lake, traverse ledges around the lake's east side, follow the trail to Stuart Pass, and descend northwest on talus. Ascend more talus to Goat Pass, traverse Stuart Glacier, and reach the 4th class gully leading to the North Ridge's prominent notch, marking the beginning of the upper ridge. If descending via LPTH, head down from the summit towards the false summit via blocky terrain, follow cairns and a ledge system east, and descend the seemingly endless Cascadian Couloir, eventually reaching Ingalls Creek.\nScramble to the false summit. Descend steep snow or scree then keep right through sparse trees to enter the Cascadian Couloir. Descend all the way  to the valley floor, and then you can go back to via Long\u2019s peak or Ingalls Lake. \n\nThis route is incredible and a must-do for anyone at ease with alpine rock climbing at this level. Keep in mind, though, that it's quite challenging and requires serious commitment.

{"instruction":"What if you could spend your life never sleeping? What would you do with the extra hours in each day?","response":"If I could spend my life never sleeping, some of the things I might do with that extra time include:\n\n*  Spend more time with friends and family. I can use the extra time to develop stronger ties and bonds with my loved ones, including my family members and close friends. I might watch films more often with them or host games at night that we can play together. Or, I might organize more potluck parties where each one bring a dish.  \n\n*  Enjoy my favorite hobbies more (or discover new ones). I could use the extra time to take dance and music lessons, read more fiction books, collect action figures, etc. In addition, I would love to develop some new hobbies that I have always wanted to try, e.g. skiing and bouldering. \n\n*  Travel and see more of the world. If I had lots of extra time, I would use them to travel around the world to experience life in different ways. I could explore new places, cultures, cuisines, traditions, and ways of living. I can also make friends with people from different backgrounds.\n\n*  Exercise and improve my physical condition. With more extra time, I would become more active and commit to a healtier lifestyle. For example, I'll stick to a regular fitness plan and increase my physical activity by adding strength training and taking a Yogo class. \n\n*  Work more to advance my career and personal growth. I might use the extra time to learn new skills outside of my primary career. For example, I would learn a new language or pursue a part-time job in art history or education. Moreover, I would get out of my comfort zone and become more proactive in buidling my network. \n\n*  Get more involved in my community. With all of the extra time available to me, I could devote myself to volunteering or giving back to my local community. This might involve working with organizations like soup kitchens, animal shelters, or environmental conservation groups. Alternatively, I might consider starting my own nonprofit organization focused on addressing issues that matter most to me.

{"instruction":"Imagine you are in charge of reforming school education, what would you change?","response":"If I were in charge of reforming school education, here are some changes I would make:\n\n*  Reduce standardized tests and eliminate the stigma associated with failing them. The focus on testing is harmful in so many ways. It encourages teaching to the test and rote learning. It leads to gaming the system by teachers and students. It leads to a narrowing of the curriculum as schools focus on the subjects that are tested. It discriminates against kids who aren't good at taking tests, especially kids with ADHD, dyslexia and other learning disabilities. There needs to be more evaluation of critical thinking and reasoning skills, and less emphasis on memorization and regurgitation. \n*  Enhance teacher training and support. I would make teacher education more rigorous, with more emphasis on pedagogy and less on content. A good teacher does not need to know all the answers, but needs to know how to find the answers, and how to inspire and guide students. In addition, I would make it compulsory for teachers to keep updating their knowledge of both their subject and of teaching methods. \n*  Increase government fundings for teacher training. I would invest heavily in teacher training and professional development and ensure that teachers are well supported, respected and fairly paid.<\\lit>\n*  Introduce a course on logical fallacies, starting with the most basic ones like appeal to authority, ad hominem, red herring, tu quoque, appeal to tradition, appeal to emotion, etc. I would also introduce a course on critical thinking, which would be more practical than the previous one. Students would learn how to formulate arguments and evaluate them, how to distinguish between good and bad arguments, etc.\n*  Ensure that students receive a balanced curriculum including the arts, humanities and sciences. Schools should be evaluated on how well they develop the whole student, including their social, emotional and physical wellbeing.<\\lit>","primary_tag":"Brainstorming","other_tags":"Reasoning,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"What is the difference between parliamentary and presidential democracies?","response":"Democracies come in various shapes and sizes. One way of classifying democracies is into presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary democracies. The key differences lie in the checks and balances between the executive branch (the government) and the legislative branch (the legislature):\n\n*  In a presidential democracy, the government is not responsible to the legislature, i.e. it cannot be removed by a vote of no-confidence. For example, in the United States, the president is elected separately from Congress, and cannot be removed by congress during their term, apart from extreme circumstances (impeachment and conviction).\n\n*  In a semi-presidential democracy, the head of state is elected independently of the legislature, and is not responsible to the legislature, but the government is. For example, France is a semi-presidential democracy, where the president is elected directly by the citizens, but the government and prime minister are voted in by the parliament.\n\n*  In a parliamentary democracy, the government is responsible to the legislature, aligning the executive and legislative branches.

{"instruction":"Write an essay with an Outline on the following topic: \"How to learn a foreign language?\" with max of 350 words.","response":"Learning a foreign language is an important skill that can open up countless opportunities and experiences. Whether for travel, work, or personal growth, knowing how to speak a second or third language is a valuable asset in today\u2019s increasingly globalized world. While it may sometimes seem like a daunting undertaking, there are several key strategies that can help make learning a new language easier and more effective.\n\nOne of the first steps in learning a foreign language is to set a goal. This could be something as simple as learning a few key phrases before a trip abroad or something more long term, such as achieving fluency in a language for work or personal reasons. Setting a goal provides a clear endpoint and motivation to keep going.\n\nOnce a goal has been established, it\u2019s important to create a structured learning plan. This can include setting aside dedicated study time each day or week, focusing on specific aspects of the language (such as grammar or vocabulary), and setting measurable benchmarks to track progress. A learning plan keeps things organized and ensures that steady progress is being made toward the ultimate goal.\n\nImmersion is one of the best ways to learn a foreign language quickly and effectively. This can involve watching movies without subtitles, reading books in the target language, listening to podcasts, or even taking a trip to a foreign country. Immersive learning helps build confidence speaking the language and exposes learners to new words and concepts in a natural way.\n\nPracticing regularly is essential when learning a foreign language. This can take many forms, including talking to native speakers, practicing with flashcards, using online programs, or simply thinking in the target language. Practice reinforces what has already been learned and helps develop new skills. It also builds confidence, which is crucial for improving language ability.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that learning a foreign language takes time and practice. Don\u2019t get discouraged if progress seems slow - every little bit counts! With dedication and perseverance, anyone can become multilingual.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Here are a few paragraphs that I took out of Wikipedia:\n* The Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the Mario series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the New Super Mario Bros. series). In early Mario games such as Super Mario Bros., special, well-hidden areas known as Warp Zones contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.[19] In the New Super Mario Bros. series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. Cannons appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with Super Mario 64. The character uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming themself and being fired at a distant target. This allows the character to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n* Much of the supporting cast was introduced in the succeeding games for the Genesis and its add-ons. Sonic 2 introduced Sonic's sidekick Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a fox who can fly using his two tails.[208] Sonic CD introduced Amy Rose, a pink hedgehog and Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend, and Metal Sonic, a robotic doppelg\u00e4nger of Sonic created by Eggman.[209] Sonic 3 introduced Sonic's rival Knuckles, a red echidna and the guardian of the Master Emerald.[210] The Master Emerald, introduced in Sonic & Knuckles,[211] controls the power of the Chaos Emeralds.[201] Knuckles' Chaotix introduced the Chaotix, a group comprising Espio the Chameleon, Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee.[212] A number of characters introduced during this period, such as Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel from SegaSonic the Hedgehog and Fang the Sniper from Sonic Triple Trouble (1994), faded into obscurity, although they sometimes reappear.[38][213]\n* Some Easter eggs originated from in-jokes between members of the development team. One example is \"Toasty\", which found its way into the game in the form of a small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an uppercut) and yell the phrase \"Toasty!\", originating from him saying \"you're toast\".[45] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage in Mortal Kombat II.[42] In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say \"Toasty! 3D!\" after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series.[46] \"Toasty!\" is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title,[47] but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game. Yet another private joke was the hidden character Noob Saibot, who has appeared in various versions of the game starting with Mortal Kombat II. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.[48] In addition, a counter for ERMACS on the game's audits screen (ERMACS being short for error macros), was interpreted by some players as a reference to a hidden character in the original Mortal Kombat. The development team decided to turn the rumor into reality, introducing Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as an unlockable secret character.[49][50] The hidden character Mokap, introduced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, is a tribute to Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in MK and MKII and has served as a motion capture actor for subsequent titles in the series.[51]\n\nWrite 10 quiz questions based on the information in these paragraphs.","response":"Here are 10 trivia questions based on the three Wikipedia paragraphs you have provided:\n\n1.

{"instruction":"What if the internet had never been invented? How would that have affected communication and society?","response":"If the internet had never been invented, the world would be a very different place.\nThe most immediate difference would be a much slower pace of technological development. The internet allows ideas to be shared instantly, and for collaboration between individuals who may be thousands of miles apart. It allows companies to outsource work to people all over the world, and for people to find information and learn new things at incredible speeds.\nWithout the internet, all of these things would be much slower. It would take years for a new idea to spread around the world, for example, and companies would have to rely on people local to their business for all of their workforce.\nThe world would also be a much less connected place. It's easy to forget, as the internet has become such a huge part of our lives, that it's really only been around for a couple of decades. Before then, it was still possible to travel and communicate internationally, but it was much more difficult, and as a result, the world was a much bigger place.\nWithout the internet, we would see more regional cultures and identities. In a world where it takes years for new ideas to spread, cultures have a much better chance to grow and flourish independently.\nWe would also see a much bigger difference between rich and poor countries. The internet has allowed developing countries to leapfrog in many areas of technology, for example in the way that many people in Africa have skipped landline phone networks and gone straight to mobile phones. Without the internet, these kinds of leapfrogging effects would be much less common.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How can you tell if someone is being truthful or lying to you?","response":"To tell if someone if being truthful or lying to you, here are a few things to look for:\n\n* Look for inconsistencies in what they say. If one time they said one thing, and another time they said the opposite, or if they contradict themselves within the same conversation, that's a sign that they may be lying. \n\n* Look for signs of stress. Liars often have a harder time lying when they're under more stress. Pay attention to whether or not they seem nervous. Are they fidgeting? Stuttering? Avoiding eye contact? These can all be signs that they're lying to you. However, some people are good liars, and can lie with a straight face. This is why it's best to look for multiple signs that they're lying.\n\n* Pay attention to what they don't say. If someone is lying to you, they may leave out details, or fail to correct you when you make an assumption that isn't true. \n\n* Ask follow-up questions. Liars often give short answers because they're trying to avoid giving details that may incriminate them. Follow up with questions like, \"Why did you do that?\" or \"How did that happen?\" to see if they're fumbling for an answer.\n\n* Ask questions you already know the answer to. This is a great way to catch someone in a lie. If you know the answer, you can say, \"Oh, so it was you who broke the vase, not Kyle,\" and see if they correct you.\n\n* Look for micro-expressions. A micro-expression is a brief, involuntary facial expression that reveals someone's true emotions. People who are lying may make a micro-expression of anxiety or guilt. You have to pay close attention, because these expressions only last for a fraction of a second.\n\n* Pay attention if they change the subject. This is a classic sign of a liar. If someone is trying to distract you from the truth, they may change the subject or try to redirect the conversation.\n\nAnd remember, people lie for many reasons. The simple fact that someone is lying to you does not mean that they are guilty of the crime you are investigating. They may be protecting someone else, or themselves from something embarrassing, or they may be lying about something completely unrelated. Always keep the reason for your questioning in mind, and be prepared to pursue other lines of inquiry based on the information you learn.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I am 30 years old, is it too late to start learning piano now?","response":"It's never too late to learn the piano. However, it will be harder for you than for a child:\n\n* You have to make a conscious decision to practice, whereas a child just does it because their parents told them to. This makes it easier to skip practice when you don't feel like it.\n* You probably have other responsibilities (work, family) that take up time and energy. A child usually has nothing but time and energy. This means you'll have to be more efficient in your practice, and cut out all non-essential activities.\n* You're starting from zero. A child can learn a piece of music in a few days that would take you months to learn. This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed. This will get you through the initial stages much faster.\n\nThe conclusion is that it's not too late for you to learn the piano, but it will take a lot of effort and discipline. If you're willing to put in the work, you will succeed.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"What would have happened if Ming dynasty China crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th Century? Discuss the exact details of how something like this could happen and how it would effect history up to the present day.","response":"If Ming dynasty China had crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas during the 15th century, history as we know it would have been dramatically altered. Here is one speculation of how such a scenario might have unfolded and its potential repercussions up to the present day.\n\nReal History: In the early 1400s, the Ming dynasty, under Emperor Yongle, carried out ambitious naval expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He, who explored and established trade relations across the Indian Ocean and as far west as Africa.\n\nHypothetical Scenario: In this alternate history, Zheng He's fleet ventures further eastward, crossing the Pacific Ocean and reaching present-day California.\n\nHow does this scenario play out?\n\n* Upon discovering the Americas, the Chinese encounter indigenous civilizations and establish trading relations with them. This leads to the establishment of Chinese settlements along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Chinese settlers import advanced technologies, including gunpowder, paper, printing, and agricultural practices, transforming the lives of indigenous peoples. At the same time, the introduction of Old World diseases decimates indigenous populations, akin to the Columbian exchange in our timeline.\n\n* Over the 1500s and 1600s, hybrid Chinese-indigenous societies form throughout the Americas, forming unique cultures, languages, and religions. The trans-Pacific trade between China and its colonies sparks an economic golden age in China, making it the richest empire on Earth. By reinvesting its newfound wealth in its military, the Ming dynasty does not collapse as in our timeline, instead becoming the number one naval power in the world.\n\n* In parallel, Europeans do eventually arrive in the Americas and settle parts of the Atlantic coast. Contact between Chinese and European colonies, particularly in Central America, ignites a series of local conflicts, culminating in an acknowledgement of Chinese sovereignty over modern-day Mexico in exchange for civil and cultural rights for indigenous peoples and European settlers, enforced through a non-interventionist policy of the Chinese colonial government. By creating the world\u2019s first de facto multicultural territory, this agreement facilitates a steady flow of goods, technologies, and ideas between Chinese, European, and indigenous cultures, influencing humanistic ideologies that spread throughout the New World.\n\n* Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, a unique American identity emerges from the multicultural melting pot, based on universal humanist values. This new generation of Americans finds itself at odds with Old World notions of national identity and monarchy, and eventually rebel against Chinese, European, and other external influences. Some colonies gain independence during this period, while other territories are annexed by the newly-independent American countries over the following century.\n\n* By the present day, the American continents host nations that are independent of their original Old World colonies, much like in our timeline, though they differ in geographical borders and ethno-cultural composition. China is more powerful and prosperous in this timeline, having benefited from its American colonies for three centuries.\n\nTo conclude, had Ming dynasty China crossed the Pacific and settled the Americas in the 15th century, history would have been significantly different. It is important to remember that the scenario presented here is purely hypothetical, and that the actual historical events followed a different path, with European powers ultimately dominating the colonization of the New World.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Creative writing,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"What is the genetic significance of humans being either left-handed or right-handed?","response":"Handedness is a very interesting phenomenon, but it is not as simple as being either left or right handed.\nIn most people the brain is asymmetrical, with some functions, such as language, being localised to one hemisphere. In most people this is the left hemisphere, which leads to these people being right handed as they use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control, such as writing. Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere, and while they may perform other tasks with their left hand they can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.\nThere are also people who are truly ambidextrous, capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well. These people, while rare, do not have brains that are symmetrical, but have developed connections between the two hemispheres that allow them to access both motor cortices.\nThe genetics of handedness are complex and not well understood. There does appear to be a genetic component, but it is not straightforward. Identical twins who are brought up in the same environment are not always both left or right handed, suggesting that environmental factors also play a role.\nOne of the most interesting things about handedness is how early it becomes apparent. Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness, and it is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time. This suggests that it is very strongly influenced by genetics, with environmental factors playing a minor role.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Handedness is a phenomenon.","max_prob":19.7235240936,"ccp":-0.1047026175},{"claim":"Handedness is interesting.","max_prob":19.0927581787,"ccp":-0.0624567503},{"claim":"Handedness is not as simple as being either left handed or right handed.","max_prob":31.7402801514,"ccp":-0.056771363},{"claim":"In most people, the brain is asymmetrical.","max_prob":17.5046386719,"ccp":-0.0309456466},{"claim":"Some functions, such as language, are localized to one hemisphere of the brain.","max_prob":21.8144626617,"ccp":-0.0175402785},{"claim":"In most people, the left hemisphere is dominant.","max_prob":6.0149316788,"ccp":-0.9246696694},{"claim":"The left hemisphere's dominance leads to most people being right-handed.","max_prob":9.3789138794,"ccp":-0.8544177215},{"claim":"Right-handed people use their dominant hand to perform tasks involving fine motor control.","max_prob":18.5617809296,"ccp":-0.378976971},{"claim":"Writing is a task that involves fine motor control.","max_prob":9.7170944214,"ccp":-0.4498146204},{"claim":"Left handed people have their language centres in the right hemisphere.","max_prob":9.3525133133,"ccp":-0.6969294423},{"claim":"Left handed people may perform other tasks with their left hand.","max_prob":12.107049942,"ccp":-0.5450322319},{"claim":"Left handed people can often do tasks involving fine motor control with either hand.","max_prob":18.6120662689,"ccp":-0.8673941099},{"claim":"There are people who are truly ambidextrous.","max_prob":10.3446331024,"ccp":-0.0504192926},{"claim":"Truly ambidextrous people are capable of performing tasks with either hand equally well.","max_prob":16.6852722168,"ccp":-0.0549942553},{"claim":"These people are rare.","max_prob":1.5375912189,"ccp":-0.8432198279},{"claim":"These people do not have brains that are symmetrical.","max_prob":12.4494552612,"ccp":-0.084877018},{"claim":"These people have developed connections between the two hemispheres of the brain.","max_prob":11.7997236252,"ccp":-0.8512938093},{"claim":"These connections allow these people to access both motor cortices.","max_prob":20.5213413239,"ccp":-0.0554218726},{"claim":"The genetics of handedness are complex.","max_prob":7.4689216614,"ccp":-0.3359429628},{"claim":"The genetics of handedness are not well understood.","max_prob":8.5990428925,"ccp":-0.2823980355},{"claim":"There appears to be a genetic component.","max_prob":6.196480751,"ccp":-0.349640486},{"claim":"The genetic component is not straightforward.","max_prob":4.2506341934,"ccp":-0.724205751},{"claim":"Identical twins can be brought up in the same environment.","max_prob":12.5217962265,"ccp":-0.504636814},{"claim":"Identical twins are not always both left-handed.","max_prob":4.4015045166,"ccp":-0.2930298065},{"claim":"Identical twins are not always both right-handed.","max_prob":4.5381836891,"ccp":-0.3490602515},{"claim":"Environmental factors may play a role in determining handedness.","max_prob":1.4096330404,"ccp":-0.9564194078},{"claim":"Children as young as two years old can be assessed for handedness.","max_prob":11.7599477768,"ccp":-0.3047508667},{"claim":"It is very rare for a child's handedness to change over time.","max_prob":14.4148721695,"ccp":-0.3960616336},{"claim":"It is very strongly influenced by genetics.","max_prob":10.8935489655,"ccp":-0.0376820068},{"claim":"Environmental factors play a minor role.","max_prob":4.0282826424,"ccp":-0.6292329312}]}

You can try to do this when you create a lesson plan to keep the students engaged:\n\n* Have clear objectives for each lesson and making sure to review these objectives before starting the lesson (this helps students know what is expected of them)\n* Have variety of activities to help students practice the skills being learned (this helps students with different learning styles practice the skills)\n* Have some flexibility in how the activities are completed (this helps students with different learning styles complete the activities in a way that works for them)\n* Have some extra help time built into the lesson to allow students to ask questions and receive extra help if needed (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n* Give students opportunities to work with each other to practice the skills (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n* Provide extra practice outside of class (this helps all students, but especially those with learning difficulties)\n\nI hope this helps!","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"why do people walk and talk in their sleep?","response":"The cause of sleepwalking is unknown. A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep, sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors.\n\nSleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation.

You may have had valid reasons for not sharing this information with your girlfriend earlier, such as respecting your parents\u2019 privacy and not finding a good time to bring this up. \n*  Your girlfriend\u2019s expectation. Depending on the level of closeness in your relationship, your girlfriend may expect certain levels of openness and honesty. If you have been in a higher level of intimacy, she may expect you to share your personal information including your family status with her. She may feel deceived or hurt if she discovers that you withheld information about your parents\u2019 sexual orientation. \n*  Your girlfriend\u2019s attitude towards LGBTQ+. If your girlfriend is supportive of the LGBTQ+ group, she may feel uncomfortable with your non-disclosure of your parents\u2019 sexual orientation, as she might feel her values were questioned and you failed to respect her values. \n*  Reflection on your motivation.  Take a moment to reflect on your motivations of not disclosing your parents\u2019 sexual orientations to your girlfriend. Did you hide from her intentionally? Or were you worried about your girlfriend\u2019s reactions to your disclosure? Reflecting on your intentions will help you better understand how your actions may have affected your relationship. \n\nTo sum up, while it\u2019s up to you to decide what information you want to share with your partner, understanding the dynamics of your relationship and reflecting on how the situation developed is important. It is normal for relationships to experience conflicts because it often serves as a learning curve for both parties. You can resolve conflicts by voicing your worries and thoughts,  having open and honest communication with your girlfriend and being clear about what you want, etc.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value. Students should notice that absolute value is always positive.\n* Tell students that absolute value is also helpful for understanding real-world situations. Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6\u00b0C, 1\u00b0C, and -3\u00b0C on the board.

{"instruction":"How do you know if you're in a healthy relationship?","response":"It is important to understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to your question. Every relationship is different, and there is no single way to define a \"healthy\" relationship.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that you can use. One of the most important things to remember is that a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I am nervous when speaking to a group of people. How can I improve my public speaking skills?","response":"Here are some suggestions to improve your public speaking skills.\n\nThe first thing you must do is to accept that it's normal to be nervous. Even the most seasoned public speakers still get nervous before giving a big presentation. The difference is that they have learned to control their nervousness and even use it to their advantage.\n\nSecond, you need to realize that people aren't actually out to judge and criticize you. They actually want you to be good. They want to be entertained, informed, enlightened - whatever the goal of your speech is, they want you to achieve it. When you give a speech, you and the audience have the same goal - for you to be good. So don't think that people are out to get you.\n\nThird, what you must do is to practice, practice, practice. There is no substitute for this. When you first start out, you'll be nervous even when giving a speech in front of just one other person. That's fine. Just keep practicing and you'll get better.\n\nLast, you need to learn the art of storytelling. This is a powerful technique that will help you engage your audience and keep them interested in what you have to say. Stories are powerful because everyone likes to hear stories. Even if your speech has nothing to do with stories, you can still use storytelling techniques to make it more interesting. For example, you can start your speech by telling a brief story about something relevant to your speech. Or you can use stories as illustrations or examples when explaining points in your speech.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I am a professor of computer science. Help me write an academic research proposal to fund my NLP lab. The research proposal should be about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models, and to do so using instructions (in natural language). Let's start by drafting an abstract and an introduction.","response":"Here is the abstract and introduction of a research proposal about controlling biases and unwanted behaviors in large language models:\n\n\n#Controlling Biases in Large Language Models\n\n\n##Abstract\n\nWhile large language models are unlocking previously unimaginable applications, their extensive usage also exacerbates the risk of generating toxic text that amplifies adverse biases in the training data. We propose utilizing the newfound instruction understanding abilities of large language models to identify, explain, and mitigate undesirable biases in text. Our research plan begins with a novel method for eliciting natural language explanations of why a particular text is harmful, without any training data or definition of what constitutes toxic text. We then propose to investigate whether explicitly instructing models to avoid biases using natural language prompts can steer them away from unwanted outputs. Finally, we aim to explore a more permanent solution by fine-tuning the model on anti-harm instructions (behavioral guidelines, codes of conduct, diversity training), and thus informing it on which utterances should be avoided. Successfully tuning large language models to better align with acceptable behavior will dramatically advance the ability to deploy safer, fairer models in real-world settings.\n\n\n##Introduction\n\nLanguage models, the cornerstone of modern natural language processing (NLP), are known to reflect and even amplify biases in training corpora, often resulting in racist, sexist, and generally toxic outputs. Susceptibility to such harmful biases hinders the deployment of these models and limits their applicability.\n\nA common approach for developing safer models is to try to control the training corpora. [Citations], for example, used a list of banned words to filter potentially harmful text from the C4 corpus. This simple approach fails to remove all adverse biases from the text, as toxic content can be written using words that are, by themselves, benign. Another technique for corpus intervention is data augmentation [Citations], which adds a counterfactual example for each utterance of a potentially biased text. This technique, however, only applies when counterfactual swaps are possible, e.g. gender, and it requires prior knowledge of all potential biases in the training corpus. Data augmentation enlarges an already oversized corpus, and can often create artificial and even unrealistic texts if not done carefully. Finally, various approaches perform post-training debiasing [Citations], but these often result in significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.\n\nWe propose explaining and mitigating adverse biases via natural language instructions. Our plan includes three parts:\n*  Inducing natural language explanations of adverse biases in a given text. We intend to build on our recent work on instruction induction [Citations], and prompt language models to describe \u201cin their own words\u201d whether a given text is problematic and why.\n*  Controlling the manifestation of model biases during generation by prompting language models with explicit instructions. We plan to investigate the use of both model-generated explanations and existing guidelines written for humans (e.g. code of conduct) to reduce and control adverse biases during inference.\n*  Mitigating adverse biases in the model itself by fine-tuning on behavioral guidelines. The goal is to efficiently adapt the model itself so that it (permanently) generates less harmful content. We build on recent work which shows that fine-tuning on task instructions (instruction tuning) improves the zero-shot learning abilities of language models [Citations]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has utilized this framework for teaching models what behaviors should be avoided. The success of instruction tuning suggests that our approach is viable, and we hope it can accelerate the progress towards safer, fairer models.","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Brainstorming,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Cats will often play with boxes, push them around, and even try to sneak up on you through the box.\n* Boxes are generally easy to get into, so the cat can come out of it quickly.\n* Boxes are generally quite cozy for the cat to be in, because they are mostly made of cardboard, which is a very soft material.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Cats like boxes.","max_prob":15.6188993454,"ccp":-0.0010794066},{"claim":"Boxes are great for hiding in.","max_prob":9.9976501465,"ccp":-0.839440139},{"claim":"Boxes are great for stalking prey through.","max_prob":23.5260543823,"ccp":-0.1973105687},{"claim":"Boxes are great for sleeping in.","max_prob":11.9535989761,"ccp":-0.7071527147},{"claim":"Cats have been domesticated for a long time.","max_prob":7.6040101051,"ccp":-0.9200397362},{"claim":"It would be hard to pinpoint exactly why cats like boxes.","max_prob":14.1458110809,"ccp":-0.4279046549},{"claim":"There is a box.","max_prob":5.4140338898,"ccp":-0.0632013169},{"claim":"The box provides a hiding spot.","max_prob":7.6766519547,"ccp":-0.0623660296},{"claim":"The hiding spot is great.","max_prob":8.536192894,"ccp":-0.1322507499},{"claim":"The hiding spot is for a cat.","max_prob":3.2086787224,"ccp":-0.5771409824},{"claim":"Cats have evolved to live in environments where predators are present.","max_prob":24.548740387,"ccp":-0.7201425123},{"claim":"Cats developed the ability to hide.","max_prob":7.3654146194,"ccp":-0.8845353984},{"claim":"Cats developed the ability to ambush their prey.","max_prob":8.534863472,"ccp":-0.5309033516},{"claim":"The cat can see the surroundings.","max_prob":16.9870910645,"ccp":-0.0022587244},{"claim":"There is a hole in the box.","max_prob":8.2050647736,"ccp":-0.0771198467},{"claim":"The cat can see through the hole.","max_prob":14.6204843521,"ccp":-0.0022587244},{"claim":"Cats like to play.","max_prob":6.1337480545,"ccp":-0.0139913814},{"claim":"A box can be a fun toy.","max_prob":7.0328779221,"ccp":-0.4107319497},{"claim":"Cats will often play with boxes.","max_prob":4.6875081062,"ccp":-0.7318609382},{"claim":"Cats will often try to sneak up on you through the box.","max_prob":20.0610084534,"ccp":-0.2381216612},{"claim":"Boxes are generally easy to get into.","max_prob":14.6771287918,"ccp":-0.1827010635},{"claim":"The cat can come out of the box quickly.","max_prob":18.7742710114,"ccp":-0.1639666102},{"claim":"Boxes are generally quite cozy for the cat to be in.","max_prob":27.3111839294,"ccp":-0.1516284052},{"claim":"Boxes are mostly made of cardboard.","max_prob":11.7638168335,"ccp":-0.1380038873},{"claim":"Cardboard is a very soft material.","max_prob":6.2637796402,"ccp":-0.4858441827}]}

{"instruction":"I'm struggling with insomnia. What are some tips for improving my sleep quality?","response":"Insomnia is a symptom, not a disease. The goal of treating insomnia is to address the underlying cause. Some common causes of insomnia are:\n\n* Sleep deprivation\n* Stress\n* Mental health issues (anxiety, depression, etc.)\n* Medications (both prescription and over-the-counter)\n* Environmental factors (noise, light, temperature, etc.)\n\nHere are a few things that might be helpful when you have trouble sleeping.\n\n* Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime.\n* Avoid stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol) at least 4-6 hours before bed. Caffeine and nicotine will keep you awake, and alcohol can cause you to wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep.\n* Keep your room as dark and as quiet as possible.\n* Establish a regular bedtime and wake time, and stick to it as much as possible.\n* Meditate before bed to reduce stress and anxiety.\n* Avoid looking at bright screens (computers, phones, tablets, etc.) right before bed. Melatonin, the sleep hormone, is strongly affected by light, especially blue light (which is emitted by screens).\n* Relax and wind down before bed. Read a book, have a glass of milk, do some yoga, or do some light stretching.\n* Avoid eating heavy meals right before bed.\n* Get exposure to bright light (sunlight or a bright light box) in the morning.\n\nIf none of these techniques help you sleep, or if you have trouble sleeping for more than a few weeks, you should see a doctor.  Insomnia can be a symptom of a serious underlying medical condition, and you should get it checked out.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"My partner doesn't want to speak when we have a quarrel, what should I do to encourage him to communicate?","response":"Here are some suggestions for your circumstance where your partner is reluctant to talk when you have a quarrel.\n\nFirst, ask yourself why you want your partner to talk when they don't want to. It is natural and healthy for people to need different amounts of time and space to process their emotions. If your partner is the type who needs a lot of time and space, pushing them to talk before they're ready will simply prolong the quarrel. You may very well be sabotaging yourself here.\n\nSecond, remember that you are not a mind-reader. You may think your partner is refusing to talk to you as a form of punishment, or to gain leverage in the argument, or any number of other reasons. But the only way to know why they are doing it is to ask them. You may not get a satisfying answer, but anything you learn will be better than the guesses you are making now.\n\nThird, if you are certain that your partner is simply trying to &quot;win&quot; the argument by refusing to engage, you have two options: you can withdraw from the argument, or you can engage anyway. If you withdraw, you may be giving up on something you want, but you also avoid the conflict escalating further. If you engage anyway, you may be able to convince your partner (or yourself) that you are serious about the issue at hand, and that it is worth discussing. But you may also be pouring gasoline on a fire. Be careful here.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Write a Wikipedia page about the Prague Uprising of 1848.","response":"The Prague Uprising of 1848 (Czech: Pra\u017esk\u00e9 \u010dervnov\u00e9 povst\u00e1n\u00ed), also known as the Pentecostal Storm, was an armed conflict on 12-17 June 1848 in Prague, which culminated in the revolutionary process in the Czech lands. The uprising was a spontaneous unprepared uprising, which was suppressed by the army and killed about 43 people.\n\n##Background\nFrom March 11, 1848 (Assembly in Svatov\u00e1clavsk\u00e9 l\u00e1zn\u011b) there was a political unrest in Prague, by which Prague joined the wider revolutionary current in the whole of Europe. At that time, Czech politics had already split into a liberal current (Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd, Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd) and a radically democratic one (Karel Sabina, Josef V\u00e1clav Fri\u010d, Vincenc V\u00e1vra Ha\u0161talsk\u00fd, Vil\u00e9m Gau\u010d, Emanuel Arnold). In the first phase, the moderate liberals prevailed. They preferred constructive and cautious steps, such as the establishment of the St. Wenceslas Committee on March 12. On 19 and 31 March, the Committee prepared two petitions to the Emperor, which mainly included the requirements of linguistic equality, the establishment of the National Newspaper (April 5), the transformation of the St. Wenceslas Committee into the National Committee (April 10), Palack\u00fd's Writing in Frankfurt (April 11), founding of the L\u00edpa slovansk\u00e1 association (April 30), organization of the Slavic Congress (June 2-12). Meanwhile, the radical wing also strengthened. On June 1, its press body, the Prague Evening Paper, began publishing. It was then supported by the arrival of some delegates to the Slavic Congress (especially Mikhail Bakunin).\n\nAt the beginning of June, the commanding general in Bohemia, Alfred Windischgr\u00e4tz, decided that the growing tensions would be dampened by military demonstrations of force - military patrols were constantly passing through the city, artillery batteries were deployed on Petrin and Vysehrad, a massive military parade was held on June 7, with military reinforcements from Kutn\u00e1 Hora and Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. This then increased tensions in the city.\n\nOn June 11, Prague students met in Karolinum and sent a deputation to Windischgr\u00e4tz, demanding that the army ease the situation. They were rejected, after which the students issued them as a leaflet and hung them around Prague (the so-called Red Poster). On the evening of June 11, an assembly met at the St. Wenceslas Spa [cs] in Zderaz [cs] to discuss the situation. It decided to hold a mass demonstration (so-called \"fraternal mass\") on the second day at the Horse Market (today's Wenceslas Square).\n\n##Uprising\nThe Mass was attended by the patriotic retired priest Jan Arnold (1785\u20131872), the brother of the radical democrat Emanuel Arnold. After the Mass, the participants did not disperse and marched through the city in a procession. Around noon, they were stopped by the army in Celetn\u00e1 Street. This ignited a spark of rebellion led by students and radical Democrats (the Liberals stayed away and sought a compromise with Windischgr\u00e4tz). Many barricades were erected in Prague, where the 12th \u2013 14th century was fought. On the very first day of the uprising, June 12, a stray bullet probably killed Prince Windischgr\u00e4tz's wife as she stood at a window watching street fights. The students fortified themselves in Karolinum and Klementinum and managed to capture Lev Thun, who came from Mal\u00e1 Strana to see what was happening. The next day, Thun refused to mediate negotiations with the students with Windischgr\u00e4tz. Thun was eventually released at the urging of Palack\u00fd, \u0160af\u00e1rik and Borovsk\u00fd.\n\nOn the night of June 14-15, Windischgr\u00e4tz changed tactics, the army withdrew to the left bank of the Vltava and from there began shelling the Old Town, where there were the most barricades, from artillery, to avoid fighting in the streets of Prague. News of the uprising in Prague was well received in the Czech countryside. National guards began to form there, who went to the aid of the Prague insurgents (from Litomy\u0161l, Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto, Kutn\u00e1 Hora, Kol\u00edn, Chrudim). They could no longer influence the course of the fighting. On June 17, the insurgents capitulated. About 43 people died during the fighting.\n\nOn June 18, a state of siege was declared throughout Prague and rioters began to be arrested. On June 26, the National Committee was dissolved due to the participation of some of its members in the June uprising. On July 20, the siege was lifted and the situation in the Czech lands calmed down. The revolution then took place mainly in Vienna.\n\n##Aftermath\nDuring the uprising, 43 insurgents were killed and 63 were injured. A total of 14 dead and 71 wounded were in Windischgr\u00e4tz's army.\n\nBy suppressing the Pentecostal storm in Prague, the Austrian conservative power tested that a military solution to the political situation was possible, and it was Windischgr\u00e4tz who was called to Vienna for this task.\n\nAfter suppressing the uprising, the Liberals focused on enforcing changes in the constituent assemblies (first in Vienna, then in Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e), the radical Democrats attempted a second offensive in 1849 (control of the L\u00edpa slovansk\u00e1 association, preparation of a May Conspiracy in cooperation with Mikhail Bakunin), but on May 10, they were arrested, a state of siege was declared in Prague, and thus the resistance was definitively broken.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What if we found live dinosaurs living on a remote island?","response":"The discovery of live dinosours would be a major scientific breakthrough and would have a number of implications for science, history and society.\n\nFirst, scientists would go nuts. The discovery of any new species is big news, but the discovery of a population of new species that are dinosaurs would be the biggest scientific discovery of all time. Paleontologists would fight tooth and claw to be the first to study them. The island would be immediately declared a nature preserve and probably a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The country that owns the island (if it's a country that has a good relationship with the scientific community) would be overjoyed at all the scientific attention and would do everything they could to help the scientists study the dinosaurs.\n\nSecond, the public would also go nuts. It would get a lot of media coverage. There would be huge demand for tours to the island, as much to see the dinosaurs as to see the amazing new species of plants and other animals that would almost certainly be found there as well. The country that owns the island would be overjoyed at all the income from tourists and would do everything they could to set up tours, as long as the scientists didn't object too strongly.\n\nThird, there'd be a lot of debates about whether to clone them, whether it was ethical to bring them back to civilization and what impacts they would have on the ecosystem and society.\n\nOverall, the discovery of live dinosours is a momentous event and it needs lots of discussions and careful actions to figure out what is the best way to manage the dinosours.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I'm interested in Japanese politics. Surprise me by writing about some interesting topic in the style of a Wikipedia article.","response":"Japanese politics is a fascinating topic. Here is a Wikipedia-style article about Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which is unique to Japan:\n\nArticle 9 of the Japanese Constitution (\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u61b2\u6cd5\u7b2c9\u6761, Nihon koku kenp\u014d dai ky\u016b-j\u014d) is a clause in the national Constitution of Japan outlawing war as a means to settle international disputes involving the state. The Constitution came into effect on 3 May 1947, following the surrender of Japan in World War II. In its text, the state formally renounces the sovereign right of belligerency and aims at an international peace based on justice and order. The article also states that, to accomplish these aims, armed forces with war potential will not be maintained. The Constitution was imposed by the occupying United States (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) in the post-World War II period.\n\nThere are the post-occupation U.S. military stationed in Japan under the U.S.-Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty and Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) which was founded in 1954 as de facto postwar Japanese military. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved a reinterpretation which gave more powers to the JSDF in 2014, which was made official in 2015.\n\n##Text of the article\n\nThe full text of the article in Japanese:\n> \u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u61b2\u6cd5\n> \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u3000\u6226\u4e89\u306e\u653e\u68c4\n> \u7b2c\u4e5d\u6761\u3000\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u6c11\u306f\u3001\u6b63\u7fa9\u3068\u79e9\u5e8f\u3092\u57fa\u8abf\u3068\u3059\u308b\u56fd\u969b\u5e73\u548c\u3092\u8aa0\u5b9f\u306b\u5e0c\u6c42\u3057\u3001\u56fd\u6a29\u306e\u767a\u52d5\u305f\u308b\u6226\u4e89\u3068\u3001\u6b66\u529b\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5a01\u5687\u53c8\u306f\u6b66\u529b\u306e\u884c\u4f7f\u306f\u3001\u56fd\u969b\u7d1b\u4e89\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u624b\u6bb5\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u6c38\u4e45\u306b\u3053\u308c\u3092\u653e\u68c4\u3059\u308b\u3002\n> \u2461\u3000\u524d\u9805\u306e\u76ee\u7684\u3092\u9054\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u9678\u6d77\u7a7a\u8ecd\u305d\u306e\u4ed6\u306e\u6226\u529b\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u4fdd\u6301\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3002\u56fd\u306e\u4ea4\u6226\u6a29\u306f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3092\u8a8d\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\nThe official English translation of the article is:\n> ARTICLE 9. (1) Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\n> (2) In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be sustained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\n\n##Historical background\n\nThe failure of the collective security of the League of Nations led to the realization that a universal system of security could only be effective if nations agreed to some limitation of their national sovereignty with regard to their right to belligerency, and if the Security Council which had been a \"closed shop\" during League of Nations times, would open itself up to UN Members who would cede constitutional powers in favor of collective security. Article 9 was added to the 1947 constitution during the occupation following the defeat of Japan in World War II.\n\nThe source of the pacifist clause is disputed. According to the Allied Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur (in statements made at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to re-arm), the provision was suggested by Prime Minister Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, who \"wanted it to prohibit any military establishment for Japan\u2014any military establishment whatsoever\". Shidehara's perspective was that retention of arms would be \"meaningless\" for the Japanese in the post-war era, because any substandard post-war military would no longer gain the respect of the people, and would actually cause people to obsess with the subject of rearming Japan.\n\nThe House of Representatives amended the Article and added \u201cAspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order,\u201d to Paragraph 1 and \u201cIn order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph,\u201d to Paragraph 2. Hitoshi Ashida made this tenor. Many scholars think the Government of Japan does not renounce the right (to have power) of self-defense because of this amendment.\n\nThe article was endorsed by the Imperial Diet of Japan on 3 November 1946. Kades later made statements, like MacArthur at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to rearm, that suggested he had initially rejected the proposed language that prohibited Japan's use of force \"for its own security\", believing that self-preservation was the right of every nation. The historical record, however, casts doubt on this revisionist interpretation.\n\n##Interpretation\n\nSoon after the adoption of the Constitution of Japan on 3 May 1947, the Chinese Civil War ended in victory for the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a consequence, the United States was left without the Republic of China (ROC) on Mainland China as a military ally against communism in the Pacific. There was a desire on the part of the United States occupation forces for Japan to take a more active military role in the struggle against communism during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was pulled out of Japan and sent to fight on the front lines in Korea, and so Japan was left without any armed protection. MacArthur ordered the creation of a 75,000-strong National Police Reserve (\u8b66\u5bdf\u4e88\u5099\u968a, Keisatsu yobitai) to maintain order in Japan and repel any possible invasion from outside. The NPR was organized by United States Army Col. Frank Kowalski (later a U.S. congressman) using Army surplus equipment. To avoid possible constitutional violations, military items were given civilian names: tanks, for instance, were named \"special vehicles\".\n\nOn 1 August 1952, a new National Safety Agency (\u4fdd\u5b89\u5e81, Hoancho) was formed to supervise the NPR and its maritime component. In 1954, the National Safety Agency became the Japan Defense Agency (now Ministry of Defense), and the National Police Reserve became the Japan Self-Defense Forces (\u81ea\u885b\u968a, Jieitai). In practice, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are very well equipped and the maritime forces are considered to be stronger than the navies of some of Japan's neighbors. The Supreme Court of Japan has reinforced the constitutionality of armed self-defense in several major rulings, most notably the Sunakawa Case of 1959, which upheld the legality of the then-current U.S.\u2013Japan Security Treaty.\n\n##Debate\n\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan is best understood as having three distinct elements: (1) a provision that prohibits the use of force (paragraph one); (2) a provision that prohibits the maintenance of armed forces or \"other war potential\" (paragraph two, clause one); and (3) a denial of the rights of belligerency. It is helpful to keep these distinct elements in mind in considering the operation and effect of Article 9. Paragraph one, which prohibits the use of force has been highly effective in constraining Japanese foreign policy, with the result that Japan has not used force or been engaged in armed conflict since the promulgation of the Constitution.\n\nDespite the fading of bitter wartime memories, the general public, according to opinion polls, continued to show strong support for this constitutional provision.\n\nThe different views can be clearly organized into four categories:\n* The current **pacifists** believe in maintaining Article 9 and claim the JSDF is unconstitutional, and would like to detach Japan from international wars. A stricter interpretation could also include peacekeeping operations.\n* The **mercantilists** have divided opinions about Article 9 although the interpretation is broadened to include the JSDF, and believe that the JSDF's role should be retained to activities related to the United Nations and for non-combat purposes. They advocate minimal defense spending, and emphasize economic growth.\n* The **normalists** \"call for incremental armament for national defense and accept using military force to maintain international peace and security\". They support the revision of Article 9 to include a clause explaining the existence and function of the JSDF.\n* The **nationalists** assert that Japan should remilitarize and build nuclear capabilities in order to regain pride and independence. They also advocate revision or, in extreme cases, the repeal and abolishment of Article 9 to promote renewed rearmament.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I\u2019m writing a short alternative history story with some science fiction elements.\nOne theme in my story is that the metric system (i.e. the \u201cInternational System of Units\u201d\/SI units) is officially and widely used in the United States (in everyday life, not just in science).\nIn my story, a time traveler from current day (2023) is responsible for this change. In addition, I want to base this change on real-world events, and I don\u2019t want this part to be very long.\n\nHow could my time traveler cause the US to use the metric system?\n\nBefore you answer, here are additional constraints from my story that I need your answer to take into account:\n*  The travel\u2019s time machine has just enough energy left for a single back and forth trip.\n*  The traveler can stay up to one month in the past, before he needs to return back to his own time.\n*  The traveler needs to get back alive. Therefore, it is highly preferable that the traveler won\u2019t risk his life.\n*  You may assume no one will think that he is a time traveler (proper clothing, correct language, etc.)\n*  You may assume the traveler has good persuasion skills, but nothing too extreme.\n*  Other historical consequences don\u2019t matter much. As long as there is a large country in North America that is recognized as the United States, and that country uses the metric system, I\u2019m good.","response":"For the cause of the US using the metric system in your alternative history short story, you can use the following real-world event:\n\nIn 1793, Thomas Jefferson ordered a set of instruments from France that would let the US calibrate to SI units, but the ship hit a storm at sea, blowing the ship into the Caribbean. There it was attacked by pirates (British privateers). The materials never arrived. By the time France sent a second set, the US had a new Secretary of State who didn\u2019t like the metric system.\n\nSo the traveler has two options:\n1. Change the departure date of the ship (so it misses the storm). This might require a bit of persuasion, but is mostly risk free.\n2. Help to take down the pirates. This is the less preferable option as it might incur a risk on the traveler\u2019s life.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Creative writing,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

Nod your head, say \"mm-hmm\" and apologize. \"I'm sorry you're having this experience\" or \"I understand your frustration\" work well.\n\nEmpathize\nTry to understand the cause of the frustration and express that understanding. \"I understand that you were expecting your package yesterday and you're frustrated that it hasn't arrived yet.\"\n\nProvide a solution\nNow that the customer has had their say and feels understood, it's time to solve the problem. If you're able to provide a solution that will make them happy, do so. \"I'd be happy to reship your order\" or \"I can refund your purchase right now\" are great ways to end a frustrating situation on a positive note.\n\nFollow up\nDepending on the situation, it may be appropriate to follow up with the customer after the fact.

{"instruction":"I want to organize a team night out (dinner+show). Company is paying, but I need to give them a budget estimate in advance. We're 7 members. Estimate for how much this would cost.","response":"Taking the team for a night out can be a great bonding experience. The cost per person will largely depend on your location and choice of activity. Here is a ballpark estimate of how much a team night out in a large city in the United States is likely to cost.\n\nRestaurant: Dinner per person can vary a lot, depending on location, the type of cuisine, and whether or not alcohol is included. Assuming a high-quality American restaurant that is not too fancy and moderate amounts of alcohol, a reasonable estimate would be around $80 per person, including tip. In total, this component will likely cost around $560.\n\nShow: Tickets to shows typically cost between $50 and $150, depending on the show. Let's estimate this cost at $100 per person. For 7 team members, this amounts to $700.\n\nTransportation: There may be additional transportation expenses such as taxis or parking. For a party of 7, we can assume two taxis over three legs (office to restaurant, restaurant to show, show to office). Assuming each drive will cost around $15, we arrive at a global cost of $90 for transportation.\n\nIn total, the planned team night is likely to cost approximately $1,350.

Indeed, for $x = 0$, this only yields $\\mathbb{P}(X \\ge x) \\le p$, which by assumption is greater than $e$. Since Probabilities are bounded by $1$, this inequality is poor when $pe^{-x^2} \\gt 1$, or equivalently $x \\lt \\sqrt{\\log(p)}$.

While the advancement of science might have enabled hand-made instances of motorized vehicles for very wealthy individuals, the main mode of transportation for people would have remained foot, horse, or sail. \n\n*  Communication: The Industrial Revolution enabled the creation of power and communication infrastructures, which would not exist in an unindustrialized world, forcing people to communicate slowly via physical transportation of messages. \n\n*  Agriculture: Our timeline's population boom is supported by the ability to mass produce food. In an unindustrialized world, supporting a large global population would be impossible, and there would likely be substantially less humans alive than there are today. \n\n*  Education: Industrialization incentivized public education systems. In a pre-industrialized world, most people could not read. \n\n*  Global Warming: One negative aspect of the Industrial Revolution is that it eventually led to the climate crisis Earth faces today. \n\nHence, the world would still remain in a pre-modern state.

{"instruction":"How can I develop a good exercise routine, given that I don't typically exercise?","response":"It is better to start slow and build up. Here are some suggestions for you to develop a good exercise routine:\n* First, get a full medical checkup. Make sure your heart is good, and that you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent you from exercising.\n* Start slow. If you haven't exercised in a long time, your body isn't going to be able to handle a lot. Start with walking. Do some basic stretches (don't stretch too much, it's actually bad for you if you haven't warmed up). Walk for 15-20 minutes a day, and do some light stretches (no bending over touching your toes type stuff).\n* Make a plan. Saying \"I'm going to exercise\" is pretty vague. Write down what you plan to do, and when. If you're going to lift weights, write down which exercises you're going to do, and how many sets and reps. If you're going to run, write down your route, and how long it usually takes you. Having a plan will help you track your progress, and keep you motivated.\n* Don't overdo it. If you're just starting out, twice a week is good. You need rest to build muscle, so don't be afraid to take a day off between workouts. You can always increase the frequency as you go.\n* Make it a habit. This is important. After a while, your workout schedule should become a habit, like brushing your teeth. This will keep you going in the long run.\n* Don't be discouraged by lack of progress at first. It takes a while for results to show, especially if you're starting from zero. Focus on the process, and the results will come.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Planning,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"My 6yo daughter is having trouble controlling their emotions. What should I do to help her control her feelings?","response":"That is a normal age for a child to be struggling with strong emotions.  Many children do not learn healthy ways to cope with emotions, especially the big ones like anger, sadness, and fear. It is very difficult for a child to learn these skills without help. So, the best thing you can do is model good emotional control, and teach her how to deal with her emotions.  Here are a few ideas:\n\n###Model & Teach\n* Talk about feelings.  When you are feeling something strong, tell her.  \"I'm angry right now because you didn't clean up your toys like I asked.\"  Or, \"I'm sad that you are going to school today.\"  Labeling feelings helps her learn to identify them in herself.  \n* Talk about ways to handle feelings.  \"I'm angry, and I don't want to yell at you.  It makes me feel better when I take a deep breath and count to 10.\"  Or, \"I'm sad that you are going to school today.  It helps me feel better to give you a big hug and tell you I love you before you go.\"  This teaches her ways to cope with uncomfortable feelings.\n* Help her label her feelings, and talk about ways to cope.  \"You're screaming and throwing a tantrum.  Is that because you're angry?  Anger makes me feel mad.  When I get mad I can feel my heart beat fast and my face get hot.  It helps me feel better to stop and take a deep breath.\"  This helps her learn to identify what she is feeling, and gives her ideas for how to cope.\n\n###Create Opportunities for Practice\n* Read books about feelings.  There are many great books out there that talk about different feelings, and give ideas for coping.\n* Play games that involve feelings.  There are games out there that involve identifying and talking about feelings.  If you can't find one, make up a game where you describe a scenario, and have her tell you how someone in that scenario might feel.\n* Talk about what you see on TV or in books.  When you are reading or watching TV, talk about how the characters are feeling, and how you know that.  Talk about what you would do if you were in that situation, and ask your child what they would do. This helps them learn to empathize with others and think about different perspectives.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

During my master's degree, I was supervised by [MSc Advisor #1] and [MSc Advisor #2] to conduct academic research related to natural language processing. I am preparing for the Ph.D program this fall (2023). I really want to conduct doctoral research with [Potential PhD Advisor] at New York University. Can you help me write a powerful statement of purpose? Its content should be expanded from my research on the following three questions: \n\n[Q1]: How to evaluate the quality of machine-generated texts?\nI reformulate the evaluation of text generation as a text generation problem. My first work got accepted to NeurIPS. I was invited by [Esteemed Professor] to give a talk.\n[Q2]: Can machines help with scientific peer review? \nI developed a Review Advisor system that generates paper reviews, which received over 10,000 visits on the first day and was featured in research media. We also write a technical report of over 25 pages.\n[Q3]: Can machines better communicate with humans?\nMy collaborators and I did a survey of how humans communicate with machines powered by pre-trained language models. Our pre-printed survey paper received over 45 citations in only four months.","response":"Sure, here is a statement of purpose draft based on your information.\n\n# Statement of Purpose of [Student] (CS Ph.D applicant for Fall 2023)\n\n\u201cA computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human\u201d - Alan Turing. Although I chose civil engineering as my major during my undergraduate years, I was amazed by the idea that \u201cmachines can think\u201d when I took an elective course named \u201cIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u201d in my freshman year. Especially at that time, an AI program AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the world champion of Go. In this context, I was eager to learn about AI and resolved to make computer science my second major. Although I had to take a lot more classes and bear with doubled learning pressures compared with ordinary students, I still ranked [Academic Rank] in my major. My hard work and diverse interdisciplinary background got me accepted to CMU\u2019s master\u2019s program to better pursue the field of AI.\n\nCMU offers a wide variety of resources for different branches of AI. Among all those options, I developed a great interest in natural language processing (NLP). As Alan Turing once said, an intelligent machine would deceive a human into believing that it was human. Wouldn\u2019t that be a big step towards a truly intelligent machine if a machine could communicate in natural language like a human? With this in mind, I did some preliminary research explorations under the excellent supervision of [MSc Advisor #1] and [MSc Advisor #2].\n\n## Q1: How to evaluate the quality of machine-generated texts?\nEnabling machines to generate natural language is an important and challenging task. Correspondingly, how to assess the quality of text generated by existing machine learning systems is a question worth exploring. Through an extensive literature review, I summarized the limitations of existing state-of-the-art metrics. By making a paradigm shift that formulates the evaluation of text generation as a text generation problem, those limitations are naturally solved. This novel idea was not only recognized by peer review and eventually accepted by NeurIPS at the first submission but also appreciated by [Esteemed Professor], an expert in the field, who invited me to give a talk.\n\n## Q2: Can machines help with scientific peer review?\nThis is the project I am most proud of during my master\u2019s degree. Not only because I spent one year patiently experiencing the complete research cycle from collecting data, training models, analyzing results, deploying online Demo, to writing a technical paper of over 25 pages. But also because it was my first attempt to use AI technology to solve an under-explored problem that desperately needed a solution. Our Review Advisor system received over 10,000 visits on the first day of opening and was featured in popular research media. While the reviews generated by our system lack details, they certainly can help reviewers frame their reviews. I used to think that we were striving for machines to take over human jobs. But now I see that perhaps what we need is not machines that replace humans, but machines that assist humans. If machines can communicate with humans using natural language, they can better assist humans in doing various tasks. This made me reflect on the way humans and machines communicate with each other.\n\n## Q3: Can machines better communicate with humans?\n To answer this question, my collaborators and I reviewed over two hundred relevant papers and summarized four different paradigms in the development of NLP in terms of the way humans communicate with machines (i.e., instantiated by pre-trained language models). We released a survey paper to elaborate on each paradigm, and our pre-printed paper has gained over 45 citations in only four months.\nBy summarizing different communication paradigms, I have gained new thoughts about the future development of NLP. Recently, people began to reformulate various NLP tasks into the language modeling task to communicate with models in natural language. But how to improve the models\u2019 memorization and generalization ability under this paradigm remains under-explored. This is one of the directions I would like to explore in the future.\n\nDuring my master\u2019s degree, extensive AI-related courses enriched my theoretical knowledge and opened my eyes to the landscapes of various fields, while several independent research experiences cultivated my practical skills and improved my research taste. All the previous accumulations have prepared me to continue my research in the field of NLP. With the beautiful willingness to drive this field forward, I am here applying for the CS PhD program at NYU. I\u2019m eager to join the [Lab Name] at NYU and work with the amazing researchers in NLP. I am particularly drawn to NYU because some of the professors there are researching topics that align with my current interests, specifically [Potential PhD Advisor]. I look forward to conducting research under the guidance of faculty unrivaled in this domain and working with brilliant peers. After obtaining a Ph.D. degree, I plan to look for a faculty position in academia and continue doing research.\n\n\nGood luck on your application!","primary_tag":"Editing","other_tags":"Planning,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"I need to review a paper for ICLR. Here\u2019s the overview: it addresses the  problem of handling domain-shifts that arises in generative learnt channel models in E2E communication systems in a few-shot setting, and they use a domain adaptation approach. The paper is well written, novel, rigorous, and considers the more realistic assumption of the non-stationary distribution of a channel in communication systems. However, it (1) lacks few-shot domain adaptation methods as baselines, e.g. Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation, but only compare with FDA methods. (2) The evaluation metric they use is only the SER. As the application research article, the performance of the proposed method in practical communication problems is essential.\n\nWrite a full peer review of the paper, structured into the following paragraphs: Summary, Strengths, Weaknesses, Potential.","response":"Here is a review for the paper your described:\n\n## Summary\nThe authors investigate the frequent changes of channels in communication systems and treat these changes as shifts in distribution (domain). The framework of few-shot domain adaptation is considered to tackle the problem in question.\n\n## Strengths\n* From a structural point of view: The paper is well-written. The method is clearly presented and ideas are easy to follow.\n* From an analytical point of view: The proposed approach is novel, evaluated rigorously, and compared with well-suited baselines. This paper also considers a range of scenarios with different types of domain shifts, real-world as well as synthetic evaluations. Furthermore, it  takes a step in the right direction by considering the more realistic assumption of the non-stationary distribution of a channel in communication systems.\n* From a perspective of soundness and completeness: The strength points mentioned above are sufficient evidence of the soundness and completeness of the paper. The transparency aspect of the submission is also appreciated as open-source code is provided for reproducibility purposes and other details are contained in the appendix. \n\n## Weaknesses\n* This paper's baselines only include basic FDA solutions, and it does not consider few-shot domain adaptation methods such as \"Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation\" as a comparison. This omission is worth noting since it raises concerns about the competitiveness of the proposed method. Including few-shot domain adaptation methods as baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.\n* The paper's evaluation metric solely relies on the SER. However,  it is crucial to showcase the proposed method's performance in practical communication scenarios. To demonstrate the advantages of their learning-based approach over conventional methods, the authors should consider including additional metrics that demonstrate the proposed method in real-world settings.\n\n## Potential of the paper\nThe proposed solution has great potential to be of benefit to the whole community, especially researchers interested in the application of deep learning in communication systems.","primary_tag":"Editing","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why do we put on sunscreen before going outside on a sunny day?","response":"Sunscreens protect the skin. They play an important role in blocking ultraviolet (UV) radiation from being absorbed by the skin. UV radiation damages the skin and can lead to sunburns and skin cancer. This radiation is present all the time, even when the sun isn't shining. It's just that when the sun is shining the intensity of the radiation is much higher. You can still get sunburn on a cloudy day, it just takes longer.\nSunscreen works by absorbing or reflecting UV radiation before it penetrates the skin. You put it on before going out in the sun so it has time to work.

While this line has a rather straightforward interpretation, it also prepares the listener for the following line, which is more complicated.\n\nThe second line, \"Now I'm here to split U like two and three from five,\" refers to the isotope uranium-235, whose symbol in chemistry is U235. This isotope was used in the development of the atomic bombs in the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer makes a play on words, saying that he will \"split U\" (you) like the nucleus of the uranium-235 atom during fission.

{"instruction":"Is it more important to prioritize economic growth and development, or to preserve the natural environment and protect our planet for future generations?","response":"The most important thing to remember here is that the two are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have economic growth while also protecting the environment, and in fact in many cases it is necessary.\nFor example, pollution control is often seen as an impediment to growth, but in many cases it actually leads to it. Consider the Clean Air Act in the United States. When it was passed in 1970, many predicted that it would cripple the economy. In reality, while it did cause some short-term economic pain (as any transition does), in the long term the economy grew substantially, and the cost of compliance with the act was actually less than predicted. This is because a cleaner environment leads to a healthier population, which is more productive. It also leads to less sickness, which reduces healthcare costs.\nSimilarly, investment in renewable energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in many countries. And it creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production.\nSo in most cases, protecting the environment and promoting economic growth go hand-in-hand. You can't have long-term economic growth without a healthy environment, because without a healthy environment, the economy will eventually collapse.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Why do I want to learn a new language?","response":"Learning a new language can be rewarding on many levels, both personally and professionally. Although it can sometimes seem like a daunting undertaking, there are plenty of reasons to do so.\n\n*  It enhances your brain.  The complex process by which we learn a language can increase white and grey matter volume in the brain. Some of these regions of the brain are associated with things like enhanced problem-solving, focusing, and switching between tasks.  \n\n*  It boosts your career prospects. Several surveys have shown that those who can speak more than one language have the potential to earn more money. It also means that more opportunities are available to you. Whether you want to work in a different country or in a role that requires you to be multilingual, being proficient in a second language can help significantly.  \n\n*  It improves other skills. As you work on your language skills, you\u2019ll also learn and be able to demonstrate a variety of other competencies. Learning a foreign language helps with things like creativity, multitasking, and problem-solving skills. \n\n*  It helps you meet new people. Whichever language(s) you choose to learn, you\u2019re giving yourself the opportunity to meet and interact with new people. Whether it\u2019s through a language course, learning app, or on your travels, you\u2019ll be able to communicate with people who don\u2019t necessarily share your native tongue. \n\n*  It helps cultural understanding. One of the essential elements of learning a language is understanding the different cultures that speak it. This cultural insight gives you the chance to travel to new locations (after the pandemic), immerse yourself in the lifestyle, and even improve your intercultural understanding in the workplace.

Here is a suggested daily food plan. Note that this is just an example and you will have to do some of your own research to figure out what works for you.\n\n* Start your day with a high protein breakfast such as eggs, Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Avoid carb heavy breakfasts such as pancakes, waffles, sugary cereals, etc. which will just spike your blood sugar and leave you hungry a few hours later.\n* Eat a healthy lunch including a protein, some veggies and some carbs. Avoid high carb lunches such as sandwiches, pasta, etc. that will make you drowsy and unproductive in the afternoon.\n* Eat a healthy dinner with protein, veggies and healthy fats. Avoid large dinners that will make you feel bloated and uncomfortable.\n* Snack on nuts, seeds, veggies (carrots, celery, etc.) and high protein snacks such as Greek yogurt.\n* Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8 glasses.\n\nIn addition, to keep a healthy life, get some exercise. Even if you can't make it to the gym, you can do pushups, situps and other exercises at home.

Your sister shouldn\u2019t use moral coercion to force you to compromise and fulfill her wishes. \n*  Family relationship is also important. On the other hand, you don\u2019t want to destroy your family relationship with your sister especially when she is in great need. If you have a very close relationship with her and her husband, it\u2019s reasonable that you make the decision of using your savings to help them. However, it would also be wise to seek advice from professionals and trusted family members before making any decisions about how to spend your money.\n \n\nIn conclusion, the decision is ultimately yours to make and it should be based on what you believe will have a positive impact on your future plans. It\u2019s important to have open and honest conversations with your sister and her husband about your decision and concerns.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Tell me an interesting fact about geography.","response":"Here are some interesting facts about geography:\n\n*  Bhutan is one of the most intriguing places in the world. The Buddhist kingdom is the only carbon-negative country on Earth, with strict environmental laws and cultural norms that preserve its stunning natural landscape. For similar reasons, Bhutan was one of the last countries to introduce television in 1999, and has no traffic lights to this day.\n\n*  There are currently few territories on Earth that are unclaimed by any sovereign state (terra nullius). One example is Bir Tawil, along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1902. The territory remains unclaimed by either country, because it would entail forfeiting the much larger Halaib Triangle, which is claimed by both countries. Bir Tawil has no settled population, but the land is used by Bedouins who roam the area.\n\n*  The antipode of any spot on Earth is the point on Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it.

{"instruction":"Can you write a three-paragraph essay about how to build a good family relationship?","response":"Building a good family relationship is very important for people of all ages. A good family relationship can help children grow up to be well-adjusted adults and can help adults maintain a healthy lifestyle. One of the most important things to do to build a good family relationship is to spend time together. Whether it is eating dinner together as a family or going on vacation, time spent together builds memories and strengthens the bond between family members. Another important thing to do is to be honest with one another. This means both telling the truth and being honest about one's feelings. Keeping secrets or hiding emotions can be very damaging to a family relationship.\n\nIn addition to spending time together and being honest, it is important for family members to support one another. This can mean helping each other out when times are tough or celebrating together when good things happen. It is also important to respect each other. Family members should respect each other's differences and opinions. This means not criticizing or judging one another. Family members should also take care of one another. This can mean helping out with chores or watching the kids so parents can have a night out, or it can mean taking an elderly relative to the doctor.\n\nTaking time to build a good family relationship is important, as family members will be there for one another throughout life. Children will learn how to have healthy relationships from their parents and other family members. Adults will have a strong support system to help them get through difficult times. Family members can also have fun together and make lifelong memories. While it may sometimes be difficult, it is important to put effort into building and maintaining a good family relationship.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Many modern political systems are based on Roman governmental structures, including the United States. Both the American Senate and House of Representatives were modeled after the Roman Senate and Assembly. Likewise, many modern legal systems are influenced by ancient Roman law. For example, the principle of innocent until proven guilty is rooted in Roman law. Additionally, the Romans made significant advances in engineering and architecture that are still used today. For instance, concrete was invented by the Romans, and it is still one of the most common building materials. Furthermore, many modern cities are built on Roman designs, with public spaces like squares and boulevards surrounded by buildings.

{"instruction":"I want to learn a new language. What are some resources and tips for language learning?","response":"From free apps to immersive online courses, there are many resources to learn a new language. Some great apps and online programs include Rosetta Stone, Duolingo, Babbel, etc. It\u2019s also a good idea to take language classes in person or online, where you can ask your teacher questions and practice speaking with your teacher and classmates.\n\nHere are some other tips for learning a new language:\n\n* Set your language goals. When you\u2019re first figuring out how to learn a language, you should focus on some short-, medium- and long-term goals. These can help to give structure and direction to your learning. Adding timescales to your language-learning goals can help to keep you on track and motivated. \n\n* Learn common vocabulary. This can help to quickly build your understanding in a day-to-day setting, allowing you to have and follow basic conversations. \n\n* Find a style that works for you. There are many different tools, techniques, and styles you can use when you\u2019re learning a language. Whether it\u2019s using flashcards, grammar translations, spaced repetition, immersive learning or any other approach, you have plenty of options. Figuring out the right combination of techniques can help you progress at a rate you\u2019re happy with. You\u2019ll find all kinds of apps, websites, textbooks, and other materials out there that help with different methods.  \n\n* Practice speaking. A crucial part of learning a language is being able to recognise, understand and reproduce sounds. You don\u2019t have to necessarily go out and start chatting with native speakers right away (although this can certainly help). However, talking to yourself, practicing your vocabulary out loud, and even recording yourself speaking your new language can help to build your confidence. \n\n*  Connect with a native speaker. Communicating with new people in your target language is often intimidating. You might be scared to make mistakes or feel that your current level isn\u2019t good enough. However, practicing with a native speaker can help you quickly improve your language skills. \n\n*  Engage with the culture. Language often evolves in line with the culture of the groups who speak it. Therefore, to really master a language, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re also familiar with the cultural context that goes with it. \n\nI hope this helps!","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"My cat keeps scratching up my furniture. What are some ways to train her to stop?","response":"Cats scratch furniture for a variety of reasons, so you'll have to work out why yours is scratching in particular. It's usually because it wants to claw off old nail sheaths, or because it wants to mark its territory. Here are a number of things you can do to train her not to scratch your furniture.\n\nFirst, you can trim her nails regularly. If you trim your cat's nails regularly, then it will be less likely for her to want to scratch because it will be more uncomfortable for her to do so. Plus, it will reduce the damage done by scratching because the claws won't be as sharp.\n\nSecond, you can cover the areas with something unpleasant, like tin foil or double-sided tape. This should discourage her from scratching there, and she'll (hopefully) learn to go to her scratching post instead.\nThird, you can try to redirect her attention when she starts to scratch where she shouldn't. If you catch her in the act, make a loud noise (clapping is good) and she should stop. Then, if you have a scratching post nearby, encourage her to scratch there instead. Give her a treat if she scratches the post, or praise her verbally. She'll learn that scratching the post gets her good things, while scratching the furniture gets her nothing.\n\nFinally, you can try a combination of all of the above. Trim her nails, cover the furniture, and when you catch her scratching the furniture, clap your hands and show her the scratching post.\n\nWith consistent effort, you should be able to break her furniture-scratching habit. It may take a few weeks, but it can be done.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What is the best argument for a socialist society?","response":"There are different forms of socialism, and many arguments to be made for or against each one. Here are some of the most common arguments for socialist policies:\n* Reduction of Relative Poverty: A welfare state which provides a minimum basic income for those who are unemployed, sick, or unable to work maintains a basic living standard for the poorest in society and helps to reduce relative poverty.\n* Free Health Care: Free health care at the point of use means everyone is entitled to basic health care. \n* Environment: An economy which is regulated to work towards the long-term welfare will place a higher value on environmental concerns, such as limiting pollution - even if it lowers profit.\n* Benefits of Public Ownership: Public ownership of water and the railways allows the companies to target goals such as long-term investment, low prices for the consumer and improved safety.\n* Free Education: Education is a major means for socio-economic mobility. Providing all citizens access to high-quality, free education allows for more equal opportunities for underprivileged individuals.\n\nHaving said that, there are also arguments against socialism and specific socialist policies.

This imposes additional force on the knee, which is a frequent site of osteoarthritis among women.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"High heels can impact your health.","max_prob":4.1237444878,"ccp":-0.937729914},{"claim":"The impact of high heels on your health can be negative.","max_prob":8.4416189194,"ccp":-0.937729914},{"claim":"Many shoes have a narrow toebox.","max_prob":10.0285005569,"ccp":-0.1545368359},{"claim":"Many shoes have a tight toebox.","max_prob":10.5595216751,"ccp":-0.1597012325},{"claim":"A narrow toebox places pressure on the toes.","max_prob":14.5064687729,"ccp":-0.1502499025},{"claim":"A tight toebox places pressure on the toes.","max_prob":15.0374917984,"ccp":-0.1484011893},{"claim":"High heels tighten up the Achilles tendon.","max_prob":15.8338327408,"ccp":-0.5541131286},{"claim":"High heels shorten the Achilles tendon.","max_prob":6.446955204,"ccp":-0.5059203882},{"claim":"Tightening and shortening of the Achilles tendon might cause pain around the heel.","max_prob":37.9077072144,"ccp":-0.3327773082},{"claim":"Calf muscles can shorten over time.","max_prob":10.2552576065,"ccp":-0.9909143944},{"claim":"Calf muscles are constantly flexed while wearing high heels.","max_prob":10.5133161545,"ccp":-0.354469144},{"claim":"Wearing heels alters posture.","max_prob":8.0876293182,"ccp":-0.7462213031},{"claim":"The altered posture pushes the body forward.","max_prob":16.1509037018,"ccp":-0.770244913},{"claim":"Additional force is imposed on the knee.","max_prob":17.1221618652,"ccp":-0.3934791704},{"claim":"The knee is a frequent site of osteoarthritis among women.","max_prob":25.2261199951,"ccp":-0.5289371841}]}

How can I help her make the adjustment smoother?\n\n\n","response":"Transitioning to a new school can be difficult for kids in general, as they are trying to figure out who they are, what they like, and how they fit in with their peers. Here are a few ideas for how to help her adjust:\n\n* Talk to her about her feelings. Ask her how she is feeling about the transition. Let her know that it's okay to be sad or upset about leaving her old school and starting at a new one. Let her know that it's okay to feel excited too! \n* Find out what is bothering her, and then help her to find ways to cope. Talking with her teachers may give you some clues, as they may have noticed her acting out in class and can offer suggestions as well.\n* Encourage her to make friends. Remind her that making friends is a skill that can be learned. Talk about ways that she can meet new people, like joining an after-school club or asking a classmate to go to lunch with her. \n* Encourage her to explore her new school. Help her to make a list of the different areas of the school, like the playground, cafeteria, and library. Ask her if she would like to explore the school with you during her lunch break or after school. \n* Encourage her to take responsibility. Try to give her more responsibilities at home. Let her help you to make meals, do the dishes, or fold laundry. Let her know that you trust her to do these things. This will help to build her confidence and sense of responsibility, which will help her to feel more comfortable at school.\n\nThe most important thing that you can do is to let her know that you are there for her if she needs you. Give her some space though, and don't pressure her into opening up if she doesn't want to.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to know if your girlfriend is ready to kiss you?","response":"Kissing a girl can be nerve-wracking, especially if you don't know if she's ready for a kiss! Luckily, there are ways you can figure out whether or not she wants a kiss. Although no tip is foolproof, at least you\u2019ll have a better idea of whether it\u2019s welcome before you make the move.\n\n## Study her face\n\n1. Watch her eyes. You should be able to tell a lot about your girlfriend's desire to kiss you from her eyes. They don't say the eyes are the windows to the soul for nothing. If she looks you directly in the eye, she is probably establishing intimacy and is at least open to kissing you. Although eye contact is almost always a positive sign, remember that sometimes people look down or away because they are shy or nervous. Still, if she is not looking at you, that's a warning sign that she's not open to a kiss. Women will give you more submissive looks in some cases when they want to be kissed, such putting the chin down and subtly looking down. Slightly narrowing the eyes is a pose that many women go into when they are waiting for a kiss. Are her pupils dilated and are her eyes widening? If so, these are signs that she is enjoying being around you, so she is probably open to a kiss.\n2. Look at her lips. Women prepare their lips for a kiss. So if you want to know if she wants to kiss you, zero in on her mouth. Is she biting her lip or licking her lips? These could be signs that she is trying to moisten them for a kiss. If she is pursing her lips or they look hardened, this is a bad sign. She is closing herself off to you. If she's applied lip gloss recently, or freshened her breath, this could mean she wants her lips to look desirable to you, in the hopes you will kiss them. This is especially true if you can tell she's reapplied them (say when you went to the bathroom). If she's looking at YOUR lips, it probably means she is thinking about kissing them.\n3. Pay attention to her nose. This might sound odd, but research has shown the nose can give away signals of desire - often without her realizing it. If her nostrils are flaring slightly, she probably wants a kiss. Physically, flaring the nostrils means she is taking in more air because she is preparing for physical activity. You need to take this one in context. If she's in the middle of an argument with you, the physical activity her body is preparing her for might not be in your favor.\n\n\n## Interpret her other body language\n\n1. Watch her posture. Posture can be very revealing. Much of communication is made up of non-verbal cues. Sometimes people don't even realize they are communicating this way. If she is learning into you or toward you, even slightly, it probably means she is more open to a kiss. On the other hand, if she is leaning away, that's a bad sign. You should also pay attention to the direction her feet are pointing. If they are pointing away from you, it could be a sign she is looking for a chance to leave. Does she move away when you move slightly toward her? This is a test you can use to measure her body language interest in kissing you. Subtly create more of a zone of intimacy and see if she complies or moves away to diminish it.\n2. Study her hands. Women will use their hands to touch things or show femininity if they want you to kiss them. If a woman plays with her necklace, she's probably into you. But you should take this act in context. If she also has other body language that is open to you, that's a better sign because sometimes a woman is just nervous. If a woman is playing with or twirling her hair, it's a sign she wants you to find her attractive and is flirting with you. If she touches something else, like a glass (running her fingers over it), in even a somewhat sensual way, that's a good sign.\n3. Wait for her touches. If she has touched you recently, even in small ways, this could be her way of creating more intimacy in the hopes you will kiss her. Even the slightest of touches show desire. That means it's a good sign if she brushes her hand against your knee or arm. Touch probably means she wants to get closer to you. It's an even better sign if she touches your face. If she softly, playfully hits you on the arm, she is trying to create a playful vibe with you, which is a way that women flirt. You could test her out by touching her slightly first to see how she responds. For example, brush your feet against hers under the table and see what she does. Another technique is to touch a piece of jewelry she has lightly (earrings, necklace), and say you admire it. If she smiles and is OK with you moving closer into her space, that's a good sign.\n4. Spot whether she has open body language. When taken together, is her body language closed or is it open? If she has open body language, she is not trying to erect barriers between you. Signs of open body language include arms at the side, body tilted toward you or facing you, eye contact, feet pointed toward you. Signs of closed body language include arms crossed over chest, feet or legs crossed, feet pointing away from you, body tilted away from you, and minimal eye contact. How much personal space is she leaving between you? If it's not much, she's already open to an intimate connection with you on some level. This is a good sign for you.\n\n\n## Learn other kiss trick\n\n1. Consider how she talks to you. Does she seem like she wants to keep the conversation going? It's a good sign for you if she does. Is she asking you a lot of questions? Are they deep and personal? If the answers are yes, she probably wants a more intimate connection with you. Are you making her laugh? Laughing at your jokes (especially if they are not very funny) is a way that women flirt. Is she trying to keep the conversation going by being the one to ask questions or lead or direct the conversation? That's a good sign. It's a bad sign if she lets the conversation wither into silence between you or you feel like you're doing all the heavy lifting to keep it going.\n2. Try the triangular kissing technique. There are some techniques you can use to build sexual tension, while monitoring how she responds and communicates back. Move close to her and touch her, either her hands or legs. Slow down your breathing and words. Look at her right eye. Hold the look for a few seconds, then move your gaze to her left eye. Pause again. Now, move your gaze and hold it on her mouth. She should be more receptive to a kiss (as long as she hasn't moved away!)\n3. Spot the window of opportunity. Women you've just met will often give you a short window of opportunity for a kiss. This can be a tricky balancing act. This will be easier if she's already your girlfriend because you will be able to spot the signs more readily. A woman you've just met is also testing you. You need to give her signs that you like her when she seems receptive to you, otherwise she may feel rejected or insecure and start to pull away and try to make you chase her. If you miss the window of opportunity, she may think you lack confidence or aren't interested in her. But if you try to kiss her before it opens, she might think you're boorish or too aggressive. So monitoring body language matters.\n4. Handle her moving away. You should always be prepared for the worst: What if you try to move closer or touch her slightly, and she moves away? Maybe she's just tired or not in a good mood. Who knows? You don't want to make it worse with a bad response. Timing is everything. Act like nothing has occurred. Basically, show that you're not thrown off. You could even make a confident quip about her being cute when she's shy. Don't act angry or insecure. That's not appealing to women. Maybe she's interested in you but just not ready for a kiss yet. In that case, you could work on building more common ground and intimacy- slowly. Abandon your idea for a kiss right now and instead focus on having a great conversation with her, and remember to throw in some compliments! (Women love that.)\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to be in a relationship without your parents knowing?","response":"Do you have a relationship you want to hide from your parents? Are your parents unreasonable, abusive, or just a bit too conservative? Whether you\u2019re keeping it a secret because you\u2019re too young or because your parents won\u2019t approve due to their values, hiding your relationship can be challenging. While you could risk losing your parents' trust if they ever find out, you don't want to put yourself in harm's way or compromise your values. Communication, honesty, and trust are essential to any relationship, but sometimes you need to be less than truthful for your own mental and physical health.\n\n## Examine why you should hide your relationship\n\n1. Evaluate your priorities. Decide if it's actually a good idea to keep your relationship with your parents. Do your parents disapprove of your relationship because they are strict, protective or worrisome? Does culture, religion, or an age difference factor into their disapproval? While your parents have the benefit of life experience, only you know what your relationship is worth to you. Talk to your friends and support system. Remember that if you keep your relationship a secret, the greater the potential problems will be when it comes to light. You have a support system to help guide you in the right direction. If you just don't think the relationship is serious enough yet and don't wish your parents to make a big deal of it, some of the following instructions may be excessive. Consider how your parents may feel if you exaggerated the need for secrecy; they may feel disappointed and wonder why don't you trust them. Take risks prevention if you really go ahead. For example, think about what would you do if you are caught by your parents, think about what would you do if your parents know you are owning a separate social media account\/secret cell phone that makes use to communicate with your partner, think about what would you do if your dating relationship goes wrong, think about what would you do if you broke up, etc. Consider whether these risks\/consequences are affordable. It is recommended to be honest if you are getting caught. Once you get caught, more lies would only make you get into greater trouble, damaging a family relationship. As for dating relationship goes wrong or challenges comes, you will need great mental and physical quality to afford it without any support from your parents.\n2. Communicate with your partner. If you want to pursue your relationship despite knowing that your parents will disapprove, let your partner know why you think that this is the right course of action. Your partner may feel less important and bring resentment to your relationship if you don't clarify your stance. The longer you hide, the more difficult it is going to be. Your partner may have a valid argument if he or she has been through this situation before. For example, just because it is your first interracial relationship, it may not be the first time for your partner. He or she may have practical advice to help you understand where your parents are coming from and, above all else, having her support can help ease your stress. Your partner may also misunderstand the situation. Some people expect to be introduced at the start of a serious relationship, some are cool with waiting, and some do not wish to be introduced for quite some time.\n3. Consider the opinions of your parents. It may be difficult to hear negative opinions about someone you care about, but sometimes your parents may have a better perspective on long-term outcomes. Depending on your dynamic with your parents, they may have trouble articulating their disapproval. Relationships with parents can be complicated. It may be difficult to be open and honest but keep your communication respectful so as not to escalate the situation. For example, while you may think that you are hiding your emotions, you actually may be coming off passive-aggressive or snarky.\n4. Remember all healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication. Whether you are trying to strengthen your relationship with your partner or maintain the relationship with your parents, trust and respect have to be present for a lasting relationship. If you plan on hiding your relationship, ask yourself why sacrificing your parent's trust is the only option. Physical and emotional well-being should not be sacrificed for anyone, including your parents or partner. Will your parents become physically or verbally abusive if they found out about your relationship? Is any aspect of your relationship conflict with your parents\u2019 beliefs? If your parents\u2019 disapproval is based on prejudice or if their reaction is abusive, seek professional help. Your mental and physical health is your first priority.\n\n\n## Overcome overbear parent\n\n1. Be mature. Your parents will always be protective so show them that you are old enough to handle the responsibilities of a relationship. Firstly, show your parents that you are responsible and can follow all the rules. If your parents think you are too young for a relationship, be on time, do your chores, and study. If you can gain your parents' trust, then your parents will soon realize that you are mature enough to handle a relationship.\n2. Understand the risks of premarital sex. Parents often forbid relationships for fear of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infection. Ensure that you and your partner truly understand these risks. There is a real possibility that if you are not prepared, and you do have an unwanted pregnancy or contract an STD, your parents may not be there to support you or just can't help you (e.g., they can help you with bringing up a child to some extent, if they wish to do so; they can't cure HIV).You may not agree with your parents rules, but communicate with your partner and respect each other's boundaries to ensure you are both prepared and safe. Know that you should be respected by your significant other and that they should listen to your choices. Compromise is vital in a relationship, but this is one area where neither party should have to compromise their beliefs. Know that if you are eager to take the relationship to another level but your partner isn't ready, you must respect their choice. Never pressure your partner.\n3. Avoid PDA moments. Be discreet about your affection. You never know who is watching. A trusted friend may accidentally tell your parents in passing, not knowing that your relationship is a secret. Stealing kisses in public and other forms of PDA may seem harmless but remember that if your parents find out, they may think that your relationship has already crossed further into the intimacy threshold.\n4. Buy one new cell phone secretly. If it is possible to do so, owning a separate cell phone can help you in concealing information, but please remember that you must hide your new phone properly or you will be in trouble. If you are not able to buy one new phone, you may put a password in your original cell phone and computer if FEASIBLE. However, it is not advised to do so. Putting or changing a password on shared computer\/ cell phone may get suspicious, even some parents may ask you to unlock\/undo the password set when they check your phone or use the family computer. Delete the messages on your phone when you sleep or leave your phone unattended. It is recommended to delete partly instead of all messages because you may get suspicious if the messaging history is blank. It is best to use Incognito mode on a browser when you are online. Otherwise, erase browsing history after you have been online. However, erasing browsing history may look suspicious if the browser history has never been erased on a shared device, but if you use Incognito mode, you don't need to worry about this. In case your parents check your phone, either don\u2019t put your partner\u2019s number on your phone or use your partner\u2019s nickname or surname instead of his actual first name. It is also possible to use the masculine or feminine form of their name. For example, Brian becomes Brianna and Stephanie becomes Stephen. However, it is best to memorize your partner's contact information in your mind and don't put any of his\/her contact information on your phone.\n5. Tell your partner not to post anything on social media sites or send instant messages. If you have a social media account or use other instant messaging apps, your parents could check up on you or hear from someone else with access to your account. Create an alternate account that you can use to be romantic with your partner. This is a handy tool when dealing with long distance relationships.\n6. Have a cover. The trustworthy friends take two jobs: 1)Helping you on hiding the relationship and giving you advice on your relationship. They can support you on hiding the relationship such as collaborate on stories for your parents if you're on a date. Not only those friends can be a great cover-up for phone calls or texts, but they also act as an Intelligence Agency so that you can beat yourself to the punch to take prevention. For instance, you friends find out your parents would go to somewhere on someday, then you should take consideration before you want to meet with your partner. The another job of them is monitoring your relationship. You should acquire a political wisdom: The more voice, you make smarter decision. It is better to have more than one reliable friends so that you can listen to more than one voice if you have lots of resources to do this, even your friends could form a 'House'. However the biggest disadvantage is the larger social group, the greater chance of secret leakage even through they are royal. If your friends has concerns about your partner or refuses to continue being your alibi, heed his\/her advice. It\u2019s easy to think that one source is wrong, but if multiple sources are telling you not to continue your relationship, perhaps it\u2019s best to listen to their logic. Using them as an excuse if they don't agree to it is unfair to your friend.\n7. Hide gifts. It is best to hide all the gifts safely. It could be at the outside of your home at your trustworthy friend's home, rent storage, your partner's home, etc. It is strongly advised not to keep the gifts at your home because your parents could find these gifts easily if they are intended and diligent in scanning every corner of your house thoroughly. You're going to draw attention from your parents if you suddenly lock your closet or room. You can also agree to treat each other to lunches or movies rather than giving physical gifts.\n\n\n## Manage collateral\n\n1. Prevent your friends from commenting about your relationship with anyone. Whether it's telling people in passing or posting on each other's social media pages, convey how catastrophic it would be if their innocent comment made its way to your parents. Social media can be especially dangerous because you never know who is connected to whom. Ask your friends politely not to post any incriminating comments or pictures. It may be a wise idea not to let anyone take any pictures when you are in a group setting with your significant other.\n2. Use multiple social media accounts. The great thing about social media is that the larger sites are free. Set up as many accounts as you need to cover your tracks. Remember your password and only log on when using a device not shared with your parents.\n3. Set up a shell email account. Not only would a fake email account be advantageous because your parents won't recognize it, but you should also use it to set up your fake social media account. Remember that your parents can search for you on social media based on your email info.\n4. Adjust your privacy settings on social media. All social media will give you an option to filter what information you share with the public. Go to the Settings Menu and set up your profile so that only you and your partner have access to it. You can also select a few friends to be able to view your profile if you deem them trustworthy. You will have the opportunity to filter your updates and postings so that you can block your parents from seeing. However, the best way to block your parents from seeing is not to post anything damaging at all.\n5. Provide false information when creating shared social media accounts or when together in a public gathering. Remember that your parents can search social media sites via your date of birth, phone number, last name, school, or job. Don't make the mistake of creating a false account without ensuring every detail won't lead back to you. Change your profile name completely. Don't use your middle name, your name spelled backward, or the name of your dog. Anything remotely close to you may end up giving you away in the long run. It's better to exercise extreme caution.\n6. Hide your emotions. If you get into an argument with your partner, try not to show your parents how angry or sad you are. Don't emote in public for it to get back to your parents. Find an outlet to release your emotions. It may be difficult to be unable to share your emotions, so research ways to prevent emotional outbursts. For example, taking up boxing may work to vent frustration while listening to upbeat music in headphones may be enough to cheer you up after an argument with your partner. Only you know how to handle your emotions.\n7. Keep track of what you are telling everyone. If you are lying to a lot of people, it will become difficult to keep track of all the details. Keep your stories consistent and try to keep it as simple as possible. The more details you add, the more difficult it will be to remember them all.\n8. Frame your partner as a platonic relationship. Don't let your parents get suspicious you are hiding a relationship from them by letting them know that you have a platonic relationship with your partner that demands your time. Introduce them openly and talk about them the same as any other platonic relationship in your life. For example, if you introduce them as your coworker, you can talk about work-related issues and meetings and how you and your partner have supported one another through deadlines.\n9. Change your routine. Meet your partner at places that you would not normally go to and that your parents are not aware of. Change your social calendar so that you leave no chance of getting caught by your parents or someone who could tell your parents. Better yet, find out your parents' schedule. Not only will you be able to have peace-of-mind knowing where your parents are but you will also be able to meet your partner as far away from them as you can.\n\n\n## Deal with a difference in age\n\n1. Ask yourself if you feel like yourself around your partner. Your partner should accept you for who you are and your parents may not be able to see beyond the age difference. Once your parents see that your relationship is healthy and that you are a better person for it, it will be easier for them to see beyond the age gap.\n2. Keep perspective. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the allure of dating someone older or younger than you. Look ahead and see if the age difference will affect you in any way. Your parents may be fearful that the age gap may widen as your relationship continues. A difference in age may be more of a big deal if you are younger. Your parents may be fearful that you are growing up too soon or that an older partner is taking advantage of you. A big age gap if you're a minor and your partner isn't may also be illegal. Take their perspective into account when continuing your relationship.\n3. Understand any power dynamics. If your partner is your professor or boss, it\u2019s prudent to know the rules. Your parents may rest easier knowing that everyone is protected from any legal actions. Understand that being in a teacher-pupil relationship can get the teacher fired and, depending on your age, even jailed. This is one relationship that is better to be put on hold - for both of you. If you truly love each other, you can wait until both of you are adults, and you have graduated.\n\n\n## Deal with your parents\u2019 different value\n\n1. Surround yourself with supportive people. If you must hide your relationship because of a difference in values -- whether religious or cultural -- seek the help of people who have been in similar situations. Bide time to help your parents and\/or partner adjust to the situation. By surrounding yourself with caring and respectful people, you can rise above your parents\u2019 closed-mindedness if they are unwilling to change.\n2. Support your partner. Assure your partner that they are cared for and that you don\u2019t agree with your parents but don\u2019t want to lose your relationship with them. Build his confidence that your parents' opinions won\u2019t hurt your relationship. Let him know that he is more important than your parent\u2019s approval and that the secrecy is temporary. You don\u2019t need to put a time limit, but it can be expected that your partner may give you an ultimatum. No one wants to be in a relationship that their partner is ashamed to be in. Be prepared to choose between telling your parents or losing your partner.\n3. Don\u2019t take a side. This isn\u2019t about who is right or wrong, this is about how you define family and your own values. Everyone will have to learn to respect and accept one another if you want to have them in your life. Be strong in your own values and communicate respectfully that you are unwilling to compromise that. Hiding your relationship should not be permanent. It may take time for your parents to realize that only you know what\u2019s best for you. If it means losing your parents, that is for them to decide. Being true to yourself is what's most important for your mental, emotional and physical health.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to avoid video game addiction?","response":"Video game addiction can be very detrimental to one's health and social life. The following is a steps list detailing how to avoid becoming addicted, and how to un-addict yourself if you are already addicted.\n\n## Step\n\n1. Accept responsibility. The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. It is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them.\n2. Identify the impact. How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book? Identifying the negative impacts of the addiction will help you focus on positive improvements and getting back the things that you really are missing.\n3. Avoid blame. Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step.Also , do not make excuses : take responsibility.\n4. Stay positive. While it is important to identify the negative aspects of the problem, it is also important to focus on the goal and progress that you have made.\n5. Set limits. If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that. Choose your games correctly! If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games.\n6. Monitor your child's video game time. You are the parent, and thus you are in control. If your children do not listen to you, removal of the game console or setting of administrative control on the computer may allow you to better handle the problem.\n7. Look in your drawer of CDs. Are there more than 5 games that you have played in the last two months? Are these games open-ended (like Civilization, World of Warcraft, or Evil Genius)? This could be a warning sign.\n8. Add up the total hours played per week. This includes time spent reading walkthroughs and watching videos and discussing games in real life. Always round up! If this number is over 25, then there may be a problem.\n9. Request that your parents put you on a strict time limit for computer playing. There are freeware programs available for download that can help with this. Playing hide-and-go-seek with your parents (hiding your games) is an effective way to minimize gaming overall.\n10. Find something else to do. You know the statement \"my anti-drug...\" This statement is better phrased \"my anti-addiction...\" or \"my anti-bad habit...\" The best way to do this is to develop a variety of other things to do, with others.\n\n\n## Friends\n\n1. Count how many games you play and how long you are playing them.\n2. Fix the problem by finding friends or spending more time with the ones you have.\n3. Step two could be hard for certain people. If you can't, ask a teacher or a parent. If there isn't one available, do it on your own.\n4. Find games to do outside. Play with your friends.\n5. Go get a book at the library. Read together.\n6. Do puzzles that could help your mind. Have contests with your friends.\n7. Come up with new fun games together and stay healthy.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to physically flirt with a girl?","response":"Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don\u2019t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you\u2019re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you\u2019re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn\u2019t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty for a brunette\u201d is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you\u2019re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn\u2019t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she\u2019ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you\u2019re thinking about her. You don\u2019t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn\u2019t really exist. Just be \u201cnormal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn\u2019t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don\u2019t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you\u2019re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say \u201c you jokester.\u201d This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table\/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl\u2019s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you\u2019re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It\u2019s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It\u2019s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you\u2019re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she\u2019s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she\u2019ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You\u2019ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you\u2019ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don\u2019t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to be organized during the holidays?","response":"## Personal holiday organization\n\n1. Plan for sleep. One of the dangers of the holiday season is that you schedule too much and don't budget enough time for sleep and exercise. These 2 practices can cut your stress level in half and make it easier to stay on task during your holiday rush. It is common to reduce your exercise time slightly during the holidays, but try to get about 30 minutes of mid-intensity cardiovascular exercise 5 times per week. Don't not cut down on your sleep; aim for 8 hours per night. Moderate your alcohol intake. Although it may seem like a sedative, it can actually prevent you from getting deep sleep. Stop after a few drinks to avoid losing your energy the next day.\n2. Set a budget 2 months before the holidays. Take into account how much you can afford and then split the money between cards, postage stamps, gifts, decorations, clothing, food and even a party. Plan an overage of 10 percent in your budget. This means all of your needs should add up to 90 percent of the money you have for the holidays.\n3. Sit down with your family 6 weeks before the holiday and ask for help. If you love control, this may be hard to do; however, it will take a load off your shoulders and make everyone feel like the holidays don't come together magically.\n4. Discuss the possibility of doing a low-gift giving Christmas or a charity project with your family. If your budget is tight, then giving 1 present or buying 1 big present for the whole family might be better. Studies have also shown that charity projects can help your emotional health during stressful times.\n5. Book travel plans 3 or more months before the holidays. Ticket prices tend to go up right before the holidays. Make sure you have lower travel costs and less stress associated with travel if you and your children or parents have their plans figured out in advance.\n6. Use a calendar that everyone can see, online or in the house. Place all commitments, deadlines, family nights and tasks on it so that everyone can refer back to it over the month of December.\n\n\n## Holiday shop organization\n\n1. Schedule shopping intelligently rather than in blocks. The following are good tips that make holiday shopping more effective and quick:\n\t* Buy things throughout the year, whenever you see something that is ideal for someone. You provide more thoughtful gifts if they are catered to the person, rather than bought frantically the month before. Store your gifts in 1 place in your house and come back to your gift hiding place 6 weeks before Chanukah or Christmas. Take a few hours off work during mid-week once the holiday sales start. You will miss the rush and have a more calm shopping experience. Shop in small spurts online. Getting online for hours can be a waste of time. Keep a list in your purse of things you are looking for, and add to it. Wait until you have 2 or 3 things you know you want to search for and do your power shopping. Open 3 browser tabs and compare prices on Amazon, Overtock.com and a Google Shopping page. Don't be afraid to give gift certificates. Many stores, massage parlors, movie theaters and more provide gift certificates. Think of something that your friends or family will find truly valuable over a product you are unsure they will like.\n2. Set up a wrapping station on a table in late November or early December. Wrap gifts as soon as you bring them home. This will remove the chance that children will find their gifts and it will allow you to get both shopping and wrapping done at a slow and steady pace.\n3. Aim to finish your shopping and wrapping by December 15th. Schedule your time accordingly, so that you can enjoy the holidays and be ready for any last-minute changes.\n\n\n## Holiday cook organization\n\n1. Clean your kitchen from top to bottom before attempting holiday baking or cooking. Try to do this in late November or early December. Rearrange things that overnight guests will need, such as coffee and cereal, in an easy to reach cupboard and create a baking cupboard.\n2. Stock up on baking supplies early in the season. Buy flour, sugar and spices at warehouse stores so that you don't have to make late night runs to the supermarket. Buy some pre-made pie crusts and cookies to keep around in case you don't have time to do everything from scratch.\n3. Bake throughout the holiday season. Clear out your freezer, and then create a cooking to do list that allows you to make and freeze items every week. For example, bake 1 sweet, such as cookies or candy, and prepare 1 side dish in preparation. Cover and label the dishes very well before you stack them on a freezer. For example, \"Sweet Potatoes. Thaw and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.\"\n4. Plan a holiday potluck party instead of baking all of the food. This is a great way to lower your budget and have fun. Allow people to bring desserts, side dishes or relish to family dinners as well; they understand your kitchen is very full.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to cut carbon arrows?","response":"Carbon arrows are a lightweight alternative to aluminum, but they may not always come in the correct length you need. While you can always take the arrows into a hunting store to have them cut by a professional, you can also cut arrows at home with a rotary cutter or an arrow saw. Before you cut the arrows, be sure to measure your draw length to know how long the shafts need to be. When you\u2019re finished, your arrows will be the perfect size!\n\n## Find the proper arrow length\n\n1. Hold a tape measure out to your side with your non-dominant hand. Grip the tape measure in your nondominant hand so the tape points toward your wrist. Fully extend your nondominant arm out to your side so it\u2019s parallel to the ground to simulate holding a bow. Make sure you can easily grab and pull the tape toward you, and reposition the tape measure in your hand if you can\u2019t. Avoid using a fabric tape measure since it may give you an inaccurate measurement.\n2. Pull the tape to the corner of your mouth with your dominant hand. Grab the end of the tape with your dominant hand and slowly pull it out. Keep pulling the tape until the end touches the corner of your mouth on the dominant side of your body. For example, pull it to the right corner of your mouth if you\u2019re right-handed. Once the tape measure is fully extended, look at the measurement. Pulling the tape measure to the corner of your mouth simulates drawing a bowstring so you can get an accurate measurement for your draw length.Tip: Put your nondominant thumb on the tape measure before checking the measurement so it doesn\u2019t retract. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to measure again.\n3. Add 2 in (5.1 cm) to your measurement to find the arrow length. If your arrow is too short, it could jam your bow or cause the arrow to shoot improperly. Take the draw length measurement you just found and include an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) to ensure that the arrows are long enough for your bow. For example, if your draw length measurement was 29 inches (74 cm), then the length of your arrow should be 31 inches (79 cm).\n4. Transfer your measurement onto the arrow shaft. Start your measuring tape at the back of the arrow shaft and extend the tape toward the front. When you reach the measurement you found, use a marker to draw a line or dot on the arrow shaft so you know where to cut. Rotate the arrow 180 degrees and make another mark in the same place to use as reference. Don\u2019t include the arrow\u2019s nock in the measurement since nock sizes vary between arrows. Start at the base of the arrow shaft instead.\n\n\n## Use a rotary cutter\n\n1. Clamp a rotary cutter horizontally over the edge of the table. A rotary cutter is a handheld multitool that spins quickly to cut through materials. Use a rotary cutter with a circular carbide blade so it can easily cut through the carbon arrows without deforming them. Lay the rotary cutter horizontally so the blade is vertical and hangs over the edge of your work surface. Use a C-clamp to secure the tool to your work surface so it doesn\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re using it. You can buy a rotary cutter from your local hardware store.Tip: Make sure you can easily access the power switch on the tool so you can turn it on and off when you need it.\n2. Position the hose of a shop vacuum behind the rotary blade. Cutting carbon arrows creates dust that can cause irritation if you breathe it in, so it\u2019s easiest to vacuum it immediately to prevent it from spreading. Set the end of the hose on your work surface so it\u2019s directly behind the rotary cutter\u2019s blade. Connect the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can also use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have a shop vacuum available.\n3. Put on safety glasses and a face mask before turning the machines on. Carbon dust can cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs, so it\u2019s important to stay protected while you work. Put on safety glasses that cover your eyes completely, and a face mask that guards your nose and mouth. Once you put on your safety equipment, you can start the rotary tool and the vacuum. Even though you have a vacuum capturing most of the dust, there still may be particles floating around.\n4. Cut the arrow along the mark you made. Once your rotary tool is spinning at full speed, carefully guide the arrow so the blade lines up with the marks you made earlier. Push the shaft gently against the blade so it cuts into the carbon. Continue pushing the arrow into the blade until it cuts completely through the other side. If the blade has difficulty cutting the arrow straight through, try rotating the arrow while you hold it against the blade to make it easier.\n\n\n## Cut shaft with an arrow saw\n\n1. Attach a shop vacuum hose to the port on the back of an arrow saw. Many arrow saws have a port on the back where you can attach a vacuum hose to collect dust. Push the end of a shop vacuum hose into the dust collection port on the arrow saw until it\u2019s secured in place. Attach the other end of the hose to the intake port on your vacuum. You can buy arrow saws from hunting supply stores or you can order them online. Arrow saws usually cost around $130 USD. You can use your regular vacuum if you don\u2019t have access to a shop vacuum.Tip: If your arrow saw doesn\u2019t have a port for a vacuum hose, then set the hose as close to the blade as you can.\n2. Wear safety glasses and a face mask while you\u2019re cutting arrows. Carbon arrows create carbon fiber dust when you cut them, which can be irritating if you inhale it or if it gets in your eyes. Wear safety glasses that cover your eyes completely and put on a face mask to protect your mouth and nose. Once you have the face mask and safety glasses on, you can turn on your machines.\n3. Position the arrow on the saw so the back sits inside of the notch on the support. Your arrow saw will have a support with a notch on it so your arrow doesn\u2019t roll around while you\u2019re cutting it. Set the back of the arrow in the notch and line up the front of the arrow so the mark you made on the shaft lines up with the saw blade. Your arrow saw may have multiple supports on it. If so, make sure the arrow sits in all of the notches to ensure you make a straight cut.\n4. Rotate the arrow while it\u2019s against the saw blade to cut completely through it. Once your arrow saw is running at full speed, slowly push the arrow shaft into the blade. Once it starts cutting into the arrow, spin the arrow so the blade cuts around the circumference of the shaft. As soon as you around the circumference of the arrow, the end will fall off and you can turn off your saw. Your arrow saw may be powerful enough to cut through the shaft without rotating it.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Carbon arrows are a

{"instruction":"How to drive economically?","response":"Everyone needs to use a car from time to time, but gas can be expensive. Driving more economically can save you money and keep your car\u2019s parts from wearing quickly. By avoiding aggressive driving, managing gears and electronics, and performing regular maintenance, you can drive more economically no matter where you\u2019re going.\n\n## Avoid aggressive drive\n\n1. Brake in a controlled manner. Braking quickly makes your car lose any forward momentum you\u2019ve built up while driving. By braking gently and gradually, you may find that a stop light changes to green during your gradual approach, and you don\u2019t need to stop completely at all. This slow and steady approach saves you fuel.\n2. Accelerate smoothly. Taking off from a full stop and accelerating quickly requires your car move through progressive gears quickly. This uses a lot of gas. Accelerating slowly and more steadily will require less of your car and save you money.\n3. Minimize distractions. Whether you\u2019re distracted by a phone call, music or your kids, distracted driving can cause you to brake abruptly and accelerate quickly. This burns lots of gas and is hard on your car. It can also make you more prone to a costly accident. Try to focus on the task at hand while driving and sideline loud music and phone interruptions. Distracted driving is more than just bad economics. It\u2019s also dangerous. Take the safety of yourself and your passengers into account when you drive by giving the road your full attention.\n\n\n## Manage gear and electronics\n\n1. Use air conditioning wisely. At low speeds, using your air conditioning increases fuel consumption. Save your air conditioner for driving at higher speeds or roll your windows down to get a little air in a more economic way.\n2. Cut down on electronics. Your car\u2019s electronics, such as the headlights and window defrosters, require energy to run just as your car does. Turn off electronics when you aren\u2019t using them to drive more economically. If certain electronic elements come on automatically when you start your car, see if you can disable those settings.\n3. Use your gears effectively. Driving in a higher gear when appropriate can reduce fuel consumption and be more efficient for your car\u2019s engine. To that end, avoid changing through every intermediate gear as you drive. Skipping gears keeps engine speed and fuel consumption low during acceleration. While this technique only applies to manual vehicles, it can save you gas money and help you drive more efficiently. Several online tutorials can teach you to do this safely if you\u2019re new to the technique.\n\n\n## Perform routine maintenance\n\n1. Check your tire pressure regularly. Keeping your tires at the high end of the recommended tire-pressure range creates less resistance as you drive. This saves you fuel and money. You might also consider having your tire alignment checked to ensure your car is running straight and efficiently.\n2. Use the right specification of engine oil. Providing your car with the specific engine oil it requires can decrease engine friction. This will help your car function most efficiently, saving you fuel and money. You can find out what particular oil your car requires by reading the owner\u2019s manual.\n3. Get your car serviced regularly. Take your car to a good local mechanic to have it examined. Getting your car serviced regularly keeps all of its parts in good working order. When all parts of your car are clean and working optimally, your car will perform its best.\n\n\n## Plan your trip\n\n1. Pack light. Bringing extra luggage or hauling large items requires more gas to get your car from place to place. Drive more economically by managing the load on your vehicle.\n2. Map your journey. Getting lost certainly won\u2019t do anything for your fuel economy. Plan your trip ahead of time if you\u2019re going somewhere unfamiliar. Bringing a phone with a mapping app or GPS can make your driving more efficient.\n3. Carpool when possible. Carpooling saves gas and shares the burden of driving. Organize a carpool with a friend to places you visit frequently, such as work or school, to cut down on costs. You\u2019ll also save your car from more wear and tear.\n4. Combine errands. Rather than making lots of short trips, try to combine errands to save gas. This requires your car to start \u201ccold\u201d less frequently, which saves you fuel and money. It can be helpful to plan out the errands you have to do in a given week, so you can see what can be combined into one trip.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make rose centerpieces?","response":"Roses are a great addition to any table for any occasion. Instead of placing them into a vase, however, why not get more creative? Rose centerpieces are easy to make, and you can use silk roses or real ones. Topiaries are the most popular, but you can also create a simpler one by placing a rose into a tall vase and filling it to the top with water.\n\n## Make a silk rise topiary\n\n1. Hot glue a Styrofoam ball to the top of a glass or crystal candlestick. Cover the top of the candlestick with hot glue, then quickly press the Styrofoam ball into the glue. You can use any size Styrofoam ball you want, but something around 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) would be ideal. Keep the ball proportionate to the candle stick. The smaller the ball, the shorter the candle stick should be.\n2. Get a bouquet of mini silk roses and snip the flowers off. Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) long stem on each rose. If possible, use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Many silk flowers have wire inside the stem, which can ruin a good pair of scissors. If you cannot find wire cutters, use a pair of sturdy scissors you don't mind possibly ruining.\n3. Poke a rose into the top of a Styrofoam ball. If the rose is very loose, pull it out, add a drop of glue into the hole, then push the rose back in. You want the base of the rose touching the Styrofoam ball. You can use tacky glue or hot glue.\n4. Add more roses in a ring around the first one. Make sure that all of the roses are touching one another, including the one in the center. Once again, if any of the roses feel loose, secure them with a drop of hot glue.\n5. Continue adding roses in rings until you reach the bottom of the Styrofoam ball. When you are done, the entire ball should be covered in roses. Make sure that there are no gaps or bits of Styrofoam showing.\n6. Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the candlestick. Tie the ends of the ribbon into a large bow. For that final touch, snip the ends of the ribbon at an angle. A satin ribbon would work the best, but you can also use a sheer ribbon as well. It can match the color of your rose ball, or it can be an accent color instead, such as silver or gold.\n\n\n## Make a real rise topiary\n\n1. Soak a block of green floral foam in water overnight. This will help keep the roses stay fresher longer when you stick them into the foam. There are several different types of floral foam. Make sure that you get the kind meant for fresh flowers. You can find it in the floral section of an arts and crafts shop. Do not use regular white Styrofoam for this. You need the foam to be able to soak up water so that the roses stay fresh. Be careful when handling this type of foam. It is very soft when dry and easily dented.\n2. Put the foam block into a vessel. You can use a fancy bowl, planter, vase, or even a pedestal meant for pillar candles. It should sit below the rim of your bowl, planter, or vase. If the foam is too big, cut it down to the right size and shape. If you are setting the foam down onto a pedestal, cut it down to a rough dome or orb shape.\n3. Get an assortment of roses and put them into a bucket of water. You can use roses in all one color, or you can experiment using different colors. You can also get different shades of the same color for an ombre effect. Plan on using about 48 roses. If you plan on using multiple shades or colors, put them into separate buckets. This will make sorting through them easier. Consider using fragrant roses. This is a small detail that often gets overlooked but will add a nice touch.\n4. Cut about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) off of each stem. Use a clean pair of garden shears and cut the stems at an angle. It would be a good idea to cut off the leaves and thorns as well. If your foam block is very small, you may want to cut the stems down to about 3 inches (7.63 centimeters).\n5. Poke the roses into the foam. Insert them close enough so that the blooms touch. Keep adding roses until the foam is no longer visible. You don't have to poke the roses all the way down into the foam. If you are sticking the roses into a bowl, planter, or vase, consider sticking them in as different depths to create a dome-like effect. If you are going for an ombre effect, start with your lightest color, then move on to the darkest. You can arrange it in stripes or rings.\n6. Add some finishing touches. At this point, your centerpiece is done. You can move it to the table, and leave it as is, or you can add some more touches to it. Here are some ideas:\n\t* Arrange short, votive candles around the centerpiece. Scatter glass gems or metallic confetti around the centerpiece. Tie a satin or sheer ribbon around the base of the vessel.\n\n\n## Make an underwater vase\n\n1. Get a tall, glass, cylindrical vase. You can also use a square vase instead. You will be placing the entire rose inside the vase and then filling the vase all the way with water. Try to get a vase that is at least 12 inches (30.48-centimeters) tall. This will make your centerpiece look more elegant. Consider wrapping a crystal trim around the base of the vase. You can find it in the sticker or scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store.\n2. Trim a rose down until it is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) shorter than the vase. You will need the extra space inside the vase for the floating candle. If the rose is too tall, it will stick out of the water\/vase and ruin the effect. You can trim off the leaves or leave them on. Cut real roses with clean garden shears. Cut silk roses with wire cutters. If you chose to leave the leaves on a real rose, rinse them off under cool water. This will get rid of any dust that might muddy up the water.\n3. Insert the rose into a frog pin. A frog pin is a coin-sized metal disk with pins sticking out of it, like a hairbrush. You can find them in the floral section of an arts and crafts store. Try to wedge the rose's stem between the pins rather than straight into them. Consider adding a few more shorter roses into the pin. A frog pin is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep the rose secure. If you cannot find a frog pin, you will have to add more vase filler later on.\n4. Place the rose into the bottom of the vase. For an added effect, consider turning on a submersible LED light, and adding it into the bottom of the vase as well. Make sure that the LED light is meant for being used in underwater floral arrangements. You can find them in the floral department of an arts and crafts shop.\n5. Fill the bottom of the vase filler. Scoop the filler out of the bag with your hands, then carefully spread it across the bottom of the vase. This will prevent the filler from damaging the rose's petals. Keep filling the vase until the frog pin is covered. You can use tiny acrylic pellets or crystals, of glass gems or marbles. If you weren't able to find a frog pin, fill the bottom of the vase with 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of vase filler, or until the rose stands up on its own.\n6. Fill the vase with cool water. Stop when you are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the rim of the vase. The entire rose, including the bloom, should be submerged under water.\n7. Place a floating candle on top. Make sure that the bottom of the candle does not bump up against the rose. If it does, add more water or trim the rose down. You can use a regular round candle or a rose-shaped one.\n8. Place the vase on your table. Consider scattering acrylic gems or metallic confetti around the vase.

{"instruction":"How to extract oil from a coconut?","response":"Coconut oil is great for cooking and many other uses. Making it at home can be time consuming and tricky, but you can do it with a bit of dedication! Start by removing the meat of the coconut from its shell. Then, use a blender to combine the meat with water and make coconut milk. From that, you can refine the oil using heat or a cold-press method.\n\n## Remove the meat from the shell\n\n1. Pierce the softest eye with a metal skewer. Poke at each of the coconut's 3 eyes. You should find one that's softer. When you do, push the skewer through the eye, making a hole through it. The eyes are the small dark circles that are clustered together on the top of the coconut. You can also use a wooden skewer, but it could break. You could also try an ice pick or even just a sharp knife.\n2. Pour the coconut water into a container. Turn the hole over a container and shake out the water. It may take a moment or two to get it all out; you should end up with 0.25 to 0.75 cups (59 to 177 mL) of coconut water from each coconut. If you need to, make the hole bigger. Coconut water is good for drinking, and you won't really need it for the oil.\n3. Whack the coconut with a hammer or meat tenderizer until it breaks. Grab the coconut with a towel and turn it so the shell is exposed. Tap the coconut with the tool, turning it as you do. The shell will eventually crack. Keep tapping to expand the crack around the coconut. You can also use anything else heavy you have laying around, such as a small cast iron skillet or even a pestle. If you're using a skillet, set the coconut on a cutting board or another hard surface to crack it. You can also hit it on a hard surface.\n4. Break the shell off the coconut by cracking it in pieces. Once the shell has cracked in the middle all the way around, the coconut should break in half. Place one half face-down on a cutting board, then whack the shell with the hammer or meat tenderizer. Just hitting it a few times should make the flesh loose enough to pull out. Another option is to keep hitting it on a hard surface until the shell cracks off. Keep turning the shell to hit a new spot each time.\n5. Remove the flesh and rinse the coconut. Use a butter knife to lever out the coconut flesh. Wash the coconut pieces under running water to remove any debris from the flesh. Some people prefer to peel off the thin, brown skin, though it's not necessary. If you'd like to, use a vegetable peeler to take it off and rinse the pieces again.\n\n\n## Use a blender to make coconut milk\n\n1. Chop the coconut meat into smaller pieces. Your blender will do most of the work for you, but your coconut meat needs to be in small enough bits for your blender to get to it. Try 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes or smaller. You can use as many or as few coconuts as you want. Keep in mind that it takes quite a few coconuts to make a small amount of oil and different methods will produce different amounts of oil. For instance, 3-4 coconuts will likely only produce 0.25 cups (59 mL) of coconut oil.\n2. Add the coconut pieces to a blender and pour in water. You may need to blend your coconut in batches if you're processing a lot of coconuts at once. Only fill the blender about 1\/3 of the way with coconut. Pour in enough hot water to completely cover the coconut with an extra 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of water on top. Boil some water and then mix it with cool water so it's hot but not so hot that you can't touch it. Some people use cold water for extraction. However, you won't get as much oil from the coconut with cold water.\n3. Pulse and blend the mixture until smooth. Place the lid on the blender. Push the \"Pulse\" button 3-4 times and then set it on high. Keep blending until it looks like it's a smooth, homogeneous mixture. This process produces coconut milk.\n4. Strain the mixture through a sieve. Pour the coconut milk through a fine mesh sieve. As the mixture drains, use your hands to squeeze the pulp or chaff left behind to make sure you're getting all the milk out of it. You may need to sieve it more than once to get all the chaff out. You can also use a nut milk bag, which is specifically made for making nut milks. It's made of fine cloth, and you can squeeze the whole bag to release the milk. Alternatively, you can just use a piece of cheesecloth or muslin over a sieve, then pick up the chaff and cloth together to squeeze it out.\n5. Repeat the grinding process a second time to get all of the milk out. Put the chaff back in the blender with more water. Grind it again until it's smooth, and then pour it through the sieve. This will help release the rest of the coconut milk. You can use the pulp or chaff in other dishes that call for coconut flakes.\n6. Place the milk in the refrigerator so the cream can rise to the top. Leave the coconut milk in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours. When it's ready, you'll see the coconut cream on the top in a hard crust.\n7. Skim the coconut cream from the top of the container. Use a knife to gently slice through the coconut cream on top and run the knife around the edges. Pull the pieces of coconut cream off the top of the milk, doing your best to leave the rest of the milk behind. You can cook rice or other foods in the liquid left behind, which will add more flavor to the food.\n\n\n## Cook the mixture to separate the oil from the water\n\n1. Put the coconut cream in a pot over low heat. Don't let the mixture smoke, as you could burn the oil. Pick a stainless steel pot or something similar. Avoid using non-stick pans for this process.\n2. Cook the coconut milk for at least an hour, stirring every 5-10 minutes. You will see the oil start to separate from the solids, which will be white at first. Over time, the water will boil off and the solids will start to turn brown. Once the solids are dark brown and the oil is completely separated, you're done with the cooking process. Stir the mixture occasionally.\n3. Pour the mixture through cheesecloth, muslin, or a fine-mesh sieve. The sieve will remove the dark brown bits from the oil. Once the oil is clear, pour it into a container of your choice. Let it cool, then store it in the refrigerator or in your cupboard and use it in your favorite dishes. Put it in a container that you can spoon it out from easily, as it will likely solidify.\n\n\n## Make cold-pressed oil\n\n1. Put the coconut cream in a jar and keep it warm overnight. Add hot water bottles to the sides for warmth. You can place it in a cooler or put blankets over it to help keep it warm. This will begin the separation process, removing the water from the oil.\n2. Place the jar in the refrigerator the next day to separate the cream. Check on it after a few hours. The cream will form a hard layer on top if it's separated. If it has, pull it from the refrigerator. Use a knife or spoon to scoop the hard part into a new jar. You can discard the water or use it for cooking.\n3. Keep the mixture warm overnight again and then strain it. Place it back in the insulated area with hot water bottles. Once again, the curd will separate from the liquid below. In the morning, pull the jar out. Strain the mixture through cheesecloth and a metal strainer into a new jar. Don't squeeze the curd during this process. Let it drip out.\n4. Refrigerate and separate the oil one more time. Leave the mixture in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours. When it looks separated, pull the jar out. The hard part on top will be the oil. Use a knife or spoon to pull it out into a new jar, and you're finished with the oil. It's best to refrigerate this kind of oil, as it's hard to get all of the water out. Water can spoil the oil.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Coconut oil is great for

{"instruction":"How to pay property taxes online?","response":"If you own real property (a home or land) in the United States, you are responsible for paying state property taxes each year. While these taxes are assessed through the county where the property is located, most counties in each state allow property owners to pay their taxes online. The specific information you need to pay your property taxes online depends on where your property is located.\n\n## Calculate your payments\n\n1. Look on your tax bill. You should receive an annual property tax statement in the mail that provides information about the amount of tax you owe each year. This statement also has other information, such as a property identification number or PIN, that may be necessary for you to pay your taxes online. Your tax bill may not include any delinquent taxes, or any other tax assessments, such as supplemental taxes. Those typically are sent separately.\n2. Check online if you haven't received a bill. Just because you don't receive a bill doesn't mean you don't owe property taxes. In most states and counties, you can find out how much tax you owe by going to your state or county's property tax website. The amount of tax online typically will be more up to date than what's on your bill, so even if you have your bill handy you may want to check online. If there's a discrepancy, go by the amount online rather than the amount on your bill. Unfortunately, you may need a PIN or identification number located on the bill to access your tax amount online.\n3. Call the tax assessor's office if you need more information. If you haven't received a bill and can't find the amount you owe on the website, you can always call the tax assessor's office and ask. The clerk should be able to give you the total amount of property tax you owe, as well as any other information you need, such as a PIN, so you can pay your taxes online.\n4. Confirm the types of property tax you owe. Some states or counties may have different types of property taxes that you'll have to pay. You may have to check for different types separately. For example, in California you may have secured and unsecured property taxes. Unsecured property taxes are taxes on watercraft, airplanes, or temporary fixtures that are not connected to real property. These may be listed separately, or included on separate websites. Depending on where you live, certain types of property taxes may not be included in the online information. For example, the property tax website for Cook County, Illinois, does not include amounts for back taxes, air pollution taxes, and some other types of property taxes.\n5. Confirm due dates for taxes owed. On the tax assessor's website, you'll find information about the dates property taxes are due each year. If you have any delinquent taxes, they typically are considered due immediately. If you pay your taxes on or before the due dates you'll avoid penalties, interest, and other fees. Plan ahead, especially if you won't be able to pay the total amount all at once.\n6. Determine how much of your taxes you can pay. Particularly if you have delinquent taxes, you may not be able to pay all of your taxes at once. Access the website well before the due date, if possible, so you can budget for your payments accordingly.\n7. Check to see if your mortgage company is paying your property taxes. If you have a mortgage on your property, your monthly mortgage payment may include an escrow amount that goes to pay your property taxes. When property taxes are due, your mortgage company will withdraw the money from the escrow account and pay them on your behalf. You typically still will get a bill or property tax statement, even though you don't owe anything. Check with your mortgage company if you're not sure so you don't end up paying twice.\n\n\n## Make your payments\n\n1. Visit your county or state's property tax website. Property taxes are assessed by county governments. The easiest way to find your county's property tax website is to check on your state's website for a link. Your state will have a .gov web address, so you can be assured that the link you find from the state website is the legitimate website for your county. This way you can make sure you keep all your information secure.\n2. Enter information for your property. The information you need to enter to access your account and pay your taxes online differs among states and counties. Typically you'll have a PIN or property identification number that you must enter to correctly find your property. A street address typically isn't enough, because property may be assessed using parcel numbers or some other system of organization.\n3. Do a search for your property. Some property tax assessors may allow you to look up the property identification number you need on the website itself. Others may require you to call the county tax assessor's office to get the information you need. If you don't have the information you need, look for a link that will allow you to search for your property. When you click on the link to pay your taxes, there should be a link close to the space where you would enter the information that you can follow to get the information you need.\n4. Review acceptable methods of payment. Depending on the county, different methods of payment are accepted if you want to pay your property taxes online. Some methods of payment may come with an additional fee. If you pay using an electronic check, you typically won't have to pay a fee. Using a debit or credit card may incur a fee ranging from a few dollars to 2 or 3 percent of the amount of your payment.\n5. Make your payment. Once you've entered the information you need and chosen your method of payment, simply enter the amount of money you want to pay along with your payment information to pay your property taxes online.\n6. Print your confirmation. Once you've submitted your payment, you'll typically get a confirmation screen that will include a unique confirmation number and an option to print the page for your records. You may also get a confirmation through email. If you get an email confirmation you don't necessarily have to print a paper copy, just make sure to save the email.\n\n\n## Use other online resources\n\n1. Create a portfolio. If you own several parcels of property in the same state or county, you may be able to create a portfolio of properties on your state or county's property tax website. The portfolio allows you to manage all of your property taxes in one place. Look for a link on the property tax page that will allow you to create a portfolio, and follow the instructions. If you don't see a link, look for a FAQ page and see if anything is listed about how to link multiple properties.\n2. Set up recurring payments. Some states and counties allow you to enter payment information once and schedule payments, which are automatically deducted from your bank account or credit card. If you have the option to schedule payments, this can be helpful with budgeting. You can schedule a partial payment each month so you don't have to pay the whole thing all at once. Mark your payment dates on your calendar or set a reminder on your phone so you don't forget that the payment is coming out.\n3. Subscribe to email notifications. Some counties provide email notifications that will alert you before the due date for property taxes, or when there have been changes to your account. If you weren't able to set up recurring payments, these notifications can help you ensure you don't miss a due date and incur additional penalties and fees. If you subscribe to email notifications, you may want to add the email address to your contacts list or preferred addresses list. This will ensure you actually receive the notifications and they don't fall into your spam folder.\n4. Apply for a payment plan. Most counties allow you to set up a payment plan if you have delinquent property taxes. You typically have to fill out an application, and may be subject to a credit check. Some counties also allow payment plans even if your taxes are current, if you anticipate you won't be able to pay the amount in full by the due date. If this option is available to you, it can save you in potential late fees and penalties. A payment plan typically requires the payments to be automatically debited from your bank account.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Real property

{"instruction":"How to polish silver rings?","response":"Silver tarnishes as it\u2019s exposed to air and light. Fortunately, restoring your silver to its original gleam can be done fairly easily. Whether you use a combination of baking soda and vinegar, salt and lemon juice, beer, aluminum foil and baking soda, silver polish, or toothpaste to get the job done, you\u2019ll have your silver looking brand new in no time! Plus, each method is effective for rings with diamonds, gems, or other precious stones in them.\n\n## Cleaning rings with baking soda and vinegar\n\n1. Mix \u20442 cup (120 mL) of vinegar and 2 tbsp (28.3 g) of baking soda. Pour the 2 ingredients in a small plastic container. Then, stir the mixture 4-5 times with a spoon. You will start to see a bubbling reaction. You can use a metal or glass container if you\u2019d like.\n2. Submerge your rings in the solution for 2-3 hours. Ensure the rings are completely submerged the entire time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have an uneven clean. Check the rings every 30 minutes to see that they\u2019re completely soaked in the solution. Take them out of the mixture after 2 hours to keep tabs on their progress. If the rings don\u2019t look clean after 2 hours, stick them back in the solution and wait 1 more hour.\n3. Scrub the rings with a toothbrush. Remove the rings from the baking soda and vinegar solution after a few hours. Use a toothbrush to scrub and polish the rings, paying special attention to particularly tarnished areas.Tip: Dedicate a new, soft-bristled toothbrush to cleaning your rings and be sure to rinse it thoroughly once you're done.\n4. Rinse the rings under cold water to remove residue. Turn on your faucet and let the water get cold. Then, place the ring under the water stream and rinse it for 15-20 seconds to remove the vinegar and baking soda residue.\n5. Dry the rings with a soft, clean cloth. Use a new, lint-free piece of cloth to remove any remaining residue and buff the rings. Make sure to flip the cloth over and use both sides to clean the rings. Otherwise, some of the residue could rub back onto the rings and you\u2019ll have to start over. Do not use a paper towel to clean the rings, as this could scratch the silver.Did you know? The baking soda and vinegar create a chemical reaction which sucks up the tarnish and removes it from the rings.\n\n\n## Soaking your rings in beer\n\n1. Pour a fresh beer into a glass or bowl. Use a regular, unopened beer to clean light tarnish off of your rings. Open the beer and transfer it into a glass or bowl.You only need enough beer to cover your rings, so you may not need to use the entire can or bottle.\n2. Soak your rings for 10-15 minutes. Place your rings into the glass or bowl, then set a timer for 10-15 minutes. Allow your rings to soak so that the beer has time to remove the tarnish.Leaving your rings in the beer for longer than 15 minutes won't harm them, but it's not necessary.\n3. Rinse your rings with warm water. Hold the rings under a stream of running water to rinse off the beer. Make sure you rinse the rings thoroughly to remove all of the beer.Be careful not to drop the rings. It may be a good idea to close the drain in the sink just in case.\n4. Dry your rings using a soft cloth. First, soak up any excess water. Then, use the cloth to lightly buff the rings to remove any remaining tarnish. Your rings should look shiny and clean!\n\n\n## Using lemon juice and salt\n\n1. Add 1.5 cups (350 mL) of warm water to a bowl. Use a measuring cup to pour the correct amount of water into a bowl. Use warm water so that the salt will more easily dissolve.Don't use hot water because you don't want to accidentally burn yourself.\n2. Stir 1 tbsp (17 g) of salt and 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of lemon juice into the water. Measure out the correct amount of salt and lemon juice. Add them to your warm water, then stir the ingredients together with a spoon until the salt dissolves.It should only take a couple of minutes to mix the ingredients.\n3. Add .5 cups (34 grams) of dry milk to the mixture. Measure out the dry milk, then slowly pour it into the bowl. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the dry milk completely dissolves in the water. Once the water is an opaque, milky white, your solution is ready to use.You can try doing this method without the milk. If you don't want to use dry milk, triple the amount of salt and lemon juice you use. Add 3 tbsp (51 g) of salt and 3 US tbsp (44 mL) of lemon juice.\n4. Place your rings in the solution and soak for 6-8 hours. Slowly drop your rings into your homemade cleaning solution. Then, leave them to sit for at least 6-8 hours. This gives the solution time to work.You can leave them to soak overnight for an easy option. Otherwise, set a timer so you can check on them in 6-8 hours.\n5. Remove your rings and rinse them in warm water. Use a fork or slotted spoon to retrieve your rings from the cleaning solution. Then, hold your rings under warm running water. Rinse your rings until all of the cleaning solution is removed.Be careful that you don't accidentally drop your rings in the sink. It's best to close the drain just in case.\n6. Dry your rings with a soft cloth. Pat your rings dry to remove any excess moisture. Then, use your cloth to buff the rings, which should remove any remaining tarnish. Your rings should look shiny and tarnish-free!\n\n\n## Polishing rings with aluminum foil\n\n1. Place aluminum foil along the bottom and sides of a bowl. You can use a plastic, glass, or metal bowl or dish for this process. Rip off a sheet of aluminum foil and use it to cover the entire inside of the bowl. To ensure the aluminum foil fits securely, wrap it around the edges of the bowl and press down firmly to lock it in place.\n2. Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil. Use enough water to fill the dish that\u2019s covered in aluminum foil. Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high. Keep the pot on the stove until the water comes to a roaring boil. The aluminum foil dish doesn\u2019t need to be that big to fit a couple of rings, so you won't need a lot of water. As a result, it should come to a boil within a few minutes.\n3. Add 1 tbsp (14.3 g) of baking soda per 1 cup (240 mL) of water. If you\u2019re working with an 8 oz (230 g) container, you\u2019ll only need 1 cup (240 mL) of water and therefore only 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of baking soda. Pour the baking soda into the water and stir the mixture for about 5 minutes. The solution will froth and bubble a little bit.\n4. Put the rings in the dish so that they\u2019re touching the aluminum foil. Set the rings at the bottom of the dish. Depending on how many rings you\u2019re trying to clean, some of the rings might touch up against the side of the dish. This is why it\u2019s important to have the sides of the dish covered in aluminum foil as well. Let the rings sit on top of the aluminum foil for 5 minutes. In order for the chemical reaction to occur, the rings need to be touching the aluminum foil at all times.\n5. Pour the solution into the dish to soak the rings. Remove the mixture from the stove and slowly pour it into the dish. Wear oven mitts and pour carefully. Let the rings sit in the solution for 10 minutes. Depending on the level of tarnish, the job might be done in 2 minutes. Check your rings every few minutes to see how much of the tarnish has worn off. Once the rings look shiny and polished, you can remove them from the solution with tongs.\n6. Allow the rings to dry on a towel for 15 minutes. Take the rings out of the solution and put them on a kitchen towel. You can finish drying the rings off by wiping them with a clean, white cloth. This process works for anything that\u2019s made of silver.Did you know? The aluminum foil works with the solution of water and baking soda to reverse the chemical reaction that made the silver tarnish in the first place.\n\n\n## Using silver polish to clean your rings\n\n1. Put a small amount of polish on a clean cloth. You get can silver polish at your local hardware store or buy a bottle online. Squeeze out a dab of polish and rub it into the cloth. You can dampen the cloth if you\u2019d like. You can get a bottle of silver polish for under $10.\n2. Rub the polish in an up-and-down motion. Don\u2019t rub the polish in a circular motion. If you do this, you\u2019ll highlight the scratches in the rings. Place your fingers in the cloth and gently rub the polish over each part of your rings. The polish will eliminate the tarnish and make your silver rings shine.Tip: Use a clean cloth for each ring and flip the cloth over when you see tarnish on the fabric to avoid transferring it back to the silver.\n3. Rinse the rings and dry them with a cloth. Run the faucet for 2 minutes so that the water becomes warm. Once the water heats up, place the rings underneath the faucet to remove any excess polish. Then, buff the rings with a new, dry cloth to get the shine you\u2019re looking for. Clean the rings with an unused cloth to avoid putting the tarnish or polish back on the rings.\n\n\n## Utilizing non-gel toothpaste to clean your rings\n\n1. Apply toothpaste to your silver rings. Put a dollop of toothpaste directly on the silver. Apply the same amount of toothpaste you would use to brush your teeth. It doesn\u2019t matter where on the ring you put the toothpaste because you\u2019ll be spreading it evenly with your toothbrush.Warning: Do not use toothpaste with gel to clean your rings. The gel will not clean the rings effectively.\n2. Wet a toothbrush lightly and brush the rings, then wipe off the toothpaste. Add a few drops of water to your toothbrush and vigorously scrub the toothpaste into the rings. Get in all the tough to reach spots, such as any engravings. The toothpaste will eliminate the tarnish and make your silver look good as new. Use a new, clean, soft-bristled toothbrush for this job. Wipe off any excess toothpaste with a dry cloth.Tip: If your rings have a ton of tarnish on them, let them sit for about 1-2 minutes before finishing the job.\n3. Rinse the remaining toothpaste off with cold water and dry your rings. Turn on your faucet and place each ring under the running water for about 30 seconds. Be sure to remove all the toothpaste and tarnish residue\n\t* Pat the rings dry with a cloth when you\u2019re done.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to prevent your teen from joining a gang?","response":"Gangs can be a very bad influence on a teen.  Teens often want to join a gang because of certain issues such as racism, poverty, loneliness, and media influences. You can prevent your teen from joining a gang by education about the appeal of gangs for teens, talking and listening to your teen, and getting involved in your own community.\n\n## Educate yourself\n\n1. Learn the appeal of gangs. There are many reasons why a teen might join a gang. Learning the potential draw of gangs for teens can help you identify if your teen is at risk. Teens might seek out gangs for a feeling of belonging. If your teen feels like an outsider for any reason, he or she may seek out a gang for a sense of community. Peer pressure is also a major factor in teens joining gangs. If your teen has friends who are in a gang or associated with one, your teen may consider joining as well. Teens also don't always realize the danger of gangs. The idea of being part of a gang might be exciting, especially if your teen has been exposed to video games and other media that glorifies gang violence. If your teen has an underlying mental illness, such as a personality disorder, he or she might seek thrills through joining a gang.\n2. Investigate gang activity in your area. Location is a big risk factor when it comes to your teen joining a gang. Be aware of any gang activity in your area so you know what your teen might be exposed to at school or in the community. You can research gang activity in your area by browsing police reports and police data online. Most areas have a police blotter website where you can enter your zip code and see of any recent arrests or disturbances in your area. Talk to officials at your teen's school. Principals and superintendents should be aware if there is any gang activity occurring in their jurisdiction. Make an appointment with an official at the school and ask him or her about gang activity. Many people feel certain locations make them immune to gangs. If you live in the suburbs, for example, you might think your teen is immune to gang violence. However, in a lot of big cities gangs eventually move into the suburbs. In the Chicago suburb Evanston, for example, gang activity has been on the rise in the last few years. Be vigilant about potential gang activity regardless of your location.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the warning signs your teen is involved with a gang. Make sure you know the warnings signs regarding gang activity in teens. You should be concerned if your teen is displaying any of the following signs:\n\t* Wearing a certain color or color scheme suddenly\n\t* An increased interest in gangs, gangster music, and gangster movies\n\t* Bragging about having friends in gangs\n\t* Coming home with expensive items\n\t* Using hand gestures and signs to communicate with friends\n\t* Aggressive or withdrawn behavior\n\n\n## Work with your teen\n\n1. Talk to your teen about gangs. Education is key to keeping your teen from joining a gang. Take time to sit down and talk to your teen about the dangers of gangs. Be as frank as possible when discussing gangs with your teens. Explain that, short term, gang activity can lead to trouble with police, trouble with school, and poor relationships with family members. Longterm, make sure your teen knows gang activity can prevent them having access to education and employment options, time in jail, and a risk to their personal safety and the personal safety of their family and friends. Listen as well. Your teen may be compelled to argue or even disregard what you're saying. Try to understand why your teen is resisting. Is he or she being intimidated by a gang? Is a person your teen looks up to in a gang? Understanding the reasons gang membership is appealing to teens can help you better address the problem.\n2. Keep your teen engaged in other activities. Teens often join gangs for a sense of community or for some excitement. Keeping your teen as engaged in other activities as possible can lessen the draw of gangs. Encourage your teen to engage in activities that appeal to his or her interest. Is your teen always sketching or drawing? Enroll him or her in art classes. Is your teen athletic? Encourage him or her to join a school sports team. Is your teen interested in music? Invest in a piano, guitar, or other musical instrument. Push your teen to find an after school job. While some teens might resist the notion of working, emphasize how building a work ethic can help later on. Talk about what your teen could do with all the extra spending money. Allow your teen to have friends over at your house. You want your teen to feel most comfortable at home, where it's safe. This also gives you an opportunity to get to know your teen and his or her peers. You can encourage wholesome activities, like board games and age appropriate movies, over the kinds of activities that might land your teen in trouble.\n3. Learn how to best communicate with a teen. Communicating with teenager can be difficult. Most teens feel an increased need for autonomy and independence, which means they may pull away and rebel against you. However, learning the means to effectively communicate with a teen can help. Always listen without judgment. If your teen is willing to share something with you, let him or her. Try to stay calm and listen, even if your concerned by what your teen is saying. Remember, as a parent you're better off hearing bad news than not hearing it. Being reactionary and harsh can discourage your teen from reaching out when in need. Respect your teen's sense of privacy and autonomy. Unless you suspect a serious problem, allow your teen his or her own space. Let them have a bedroom to themselves. Do not always ask who your teen is calling or texting on the phone. Do not touch your teen's belonging without permission. Schedule times to talk. You do not need to schedule a weekly conversation, but having a family dinner night or board game night gives your teen the opportunity to share. Strive to keep communication open and keep yourself available when your teen is in need.\n4. Identify positive role models for your teen. Teens often join gangs because they feel lost. Lacking positive role models, a teen might turn to the allure of a gang. Identify positive roll models for your teen. Get your teen involved in the community. Encourage him or her to volunteer. Take him or her to church, town hall meetings, and other places and meetings you attend. Teach your teen about people you admire. This can be someone you know personally, like your great-grandmother who supported her family during the Great Depression. It can also be a public figure, like a politician or activist. Showing your teen what you believe admirable qualities constitute can lessen the appeal of gang members.\n\n\n## Improve your community\n\n1. Remove gang related graffiti. Graffiti is often a way for gangs to advertise and recruit new members. If you notice new or unusual graffiti in your area, google the images to see if they're gang affiliated. If they are, talk to the local police about having them removed as soon as possible. Depending on regulations in your area, you may be able to remove the images yourself or schedule a community cleanup. Stop by the local courthouse and ask what your options are in terms of arranging a cleanup.\n2. Team up with other parents. The phrase \"It takes a village to raise a child\" exists for a reason. You cannot do this alone. Work with other parents to build a stronger community and to keep out gangs. Schedule a meeting with other parents in town to discuss gang activity in your area. Brainstorm ideas about how to keep your teens out of gangs. Working together, you and other parents can create regular community events and activities for teens to engage in in order to discourage them from joining gangs. You can also go, as a group, to a PTA to raise any concerns you have about gang activity in the school system. Look into starting a neighborhood watch to keep on the lookout for gang activity.\n3. Take political action. In order to address gang activity, political action may be necessary. Increasing law enforcement presence in your are and providing community outreach to at-risk teens may be needed in your area. Start letter writing and phone campaigns to local members of Congress. Explain why your area needs help addressing gang violence and gang activity. Demand community outreach in your area. Raise awareness. Buy an ad on the local radio.

{"instruction":"How to change a chain on a mountain bike?","response":"No matter how cheap or expensive your bicycle is, there will come a day when you need to fix or replace its chain. The structure of a mountain bike may be more complex than the structure of a regular bike, but the chain changing process is similar. With the right tools and a little bit of patience, you'll have a new chain on your bike in no time.\n\n## Remove the chain\n\n1. Secure your bike. It's unlikely that your kickstand will be sufficient for you to get a good look at your bike without it falling over. A bike rack that has hooks from which you can hang your bike works very well, but you can also turn your bike upside down so it rests on the seat and handlebars. Inspecting your chain with your bike's wheels facing upwards will make it more comfortable for you to inspect and work on. If you don't have a rack, simply lean your bike upright against a wall.\n2. Take a picture of the chain. To make the reinstallation process easier, take a picture of the chain so you can refer to it later. Make sure your picture shows how the chain feeds through the gear mechanism.\n3. Check for a master link. A master link is a special link in your bike chain that has a pin\/slot configuration that will allow you to easily remove your chain from the bike. Two popular kinds of master links are Connex and SRAM Powerlink. Knowing where your master link is ahead of time will make chain replacement go smoother. The master link for a bike is specific to the chain size and brand. If your bike does not have a master link, you can install one yourself or have it done at your local bike shop. This installation is usually inexpensive, costing about $15 in most cases. If your bike does not have a master link and you prefer not to have one installed, order a chain-tool to remove the chain. They're inexpensive and essential pieces of equipment.\n4. Position your chain. This is especially important if you have a master link. Removing a master link that's positioned on the teeth of the chain ring or a gear can be very difficult. Positioning the master link so it is suspended at the midpoint between the crankset and the rear wheel will be easiest. If you are using a chain tool, you can still benefit from proper chain positioning. Some parts of your chain will be dirtier or have more wear than others. A clear segment of chain positioned at the midpoint between the wheels will be easiest to remove with your chain tool.\n5. Remove the chain. Now that the chain is in position, you can remove it. If you have a master link, use master-link pliers or your hands to squeeze both ends of the master link inwards so the pin comes out of its slot and the link comes apart, freeing your chain. If you're using a chain tool:\n\t* Set the chain tool on the link you are trying to remove so it aligns with one of the round holes to either side of the link. Screw the chain tool so it moves through the hole. This will push out the pin that is keeping that link together. Try not to push the pin completely free of the link. This will make it difficult, or in some cases impossible, to reassemble that link of the chain. You'll often feel a popping or snapping when the pin pushes free of the link. This is a good indicator that the link has been disengaged. Some chain tools are only intended for certain sized links, though some can be used on several different sizes of chain. Check the instructions on your chain tool before using it.\n\n\n## Attach your new chain\n\n1. Avoid using failed chains as replacements. Chains generally fail because they have reached their limit or been put under too much stress. Replacing a failed chain on your bike could result in an even more severe failure down the road. To prevent injury to yourself or your mountain bike, you should buy a new chain instead of reusing old ones. Bike chains can be bought at your local bike shop or, in some cases, your local hardware store.\n2. Measure your replacement chain. It's important that you only use the kind of chain intended for your bike. For example, an 11-speed bike will use an 11-speed chain. Hang your old bike chain so it dangles freely and do the same with your new chain beside the old one. Count the number of links if your new chain is longer than the old. This will be the number of links you need to remove. If your chain has snapped and it is unreliable to measure your new chain, you can remove links after feeding the chain into the drivetrain of your bike.\n3. Insert your chain into the gear mechanism. For more complex mountain bike, you may need to consult the picture you took of how the old chain feeds through the gear mechanism to do this properly. Simple mechanisms may be more intuitive. Pull the chain through the entire drivetrain until both ends terminate at the bottom midpoint between your wheels. Positioning the ends of your chain at the bottom midpoint between the wheels of your bike will make it more accessible and allow gravity to keep the chain on the bike until you can secure it.\n4. Remove extra links from the chain, if necessary. If your chain is loose, you'll need to remove some links. This is likely the case if you were not able to measure your chain. Shift your bike to its lowest gear, and then use your chain tool to remove links one at a time to shorten the chain until it is taut in the drivetrain. When removing extra links, avoid popping the pin holding them together completely free of the link. This will make it difficult to reattach the link if you shorten it too much. For the best ride, you'll need the chain to be strung tautly between the wheels in its lowest gear.\n5. Attach the loose ends of your chain. With a master link, all you need to do is slip the pin of the link into its slot to complete the link. If you removed your chain with a chain tool, you'll have to re-couple the split link by lining up its halves together and using a pair of pliers to force the pin back through the hole to complete the link. You should feel a click or a pop when the pin of a master link slides into place. You can also pull on the chain to either side of the link to securely seat the pin of the master link in place.\n6. Test your chain. Reposition your bike back on its rack and move the pedals manually with your hands to run the chain through the drivetrain of your bicycle. The chain should move smoothly. If you notice stiff links, these are often caused by a protruding link pin, and can be fixed by resetting the pin with your chain tool and pliers. Cycle the suspension by sitting on the saddle and bouncing up and down a few times to test your chain length. To protect your chain from the elements and to help it run smoothly in your drive train, you should lubricate your chain with a suitable bicycle chain lubricant.\n\n\n## Inspect your chain for wear\n\n1. Use a chain wear indicator to evaluate your chain for best results. You can find a chain wear indicator at your local bike shop or maybe even at a hardware store. You'll have to attach the indicator between the links of your chain and follow the directions on it to interpret its reading. Most chain wear indicators will have a sticker that establishes the values for a worn chain and an unworn chain. If your wear indicator does not, check the box it came in for these values. If you do not have a wear indicator, you can perform a hand check of the chain. Use moderate pressure to lift a section of your chain from the chainring of your bike with your fingers. A small gap should form between the chain and the ring. If you can clearly see through the gap over three or four teeth, your chain is worn.\n2. Try to join the ends of your chain to test for wear as a simpler alternative. If inspecting your chain with a wear indicator or a physical gap check aren't an option, or if your chain is already off the bike, you can also check for wear by trying to touch the ends of the bike chain. Lay your chain on a clean surface so that the holes in the chain are oriented up and down. Then:\n\t* Try to touch the ends of the chain together while keeping the holes facing up and down. Over time, chains are bent by the action of your bikes derailleur. Note the amount of sideways flex in your chain. A worn chain will have a great deal flexion. Newer chains resist touching and only arc slightly.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the drivetrain. The drivetrain of your bike is the part that transfers the energy you put into the pedals through the chain to your gears to move the wheels. You'll want to pay extra close attention to how the chain feeds into the gears. Knowing how the chain fits in the mechanism will allow you to replace it with greater ease.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The structure of a

{"instruction":"How to fuel a race car?","response":"Most race cars do not carry enough fuel to complete a race from start to finish. They must return to the pit area for more fuel, which is commonly called a pit stop. During the pit stop, pit crew members quickly put new tires on the car while fueling to the car to finish the race. Use these tips to learn how to fuel a race car.\n\n## Check the car refuel port\n\n1. Check the operation of the door on the refueling port before the car leaves the pit to enter the race. Make sure that the refueling door opens smoothly and closes firmly.\n2. Make sure that the fuel feed pipe is unobstructed. Examine the opening of the fuel feed pipe for obstructions. Clear any obstructions from the fuel feed pipe.\n3. Clean the opening of the fuel feed pipe. Wipe it with a clean, dry cloth. This will prevent any foreign substances from being swept down into the fuel feed pipe as the fuel is put into the pipe.\n4. Confirm that fuel is available for refueling. Make sure that 2 fuel delivery canisters of appropriate size and type for the race car are filled with the type of fuel required by the race car.\n5. Prepare and secure the fuel delivery canisters. Make sure that the 2 filled fuel delivery canisters are ready in the garage near the pit area. Ensure that the fuel delivery canisters are secured in baskets or by tie down straps so that the canisters can not be accidentally knocked over.\n6. Outfit 2 pit crew members with fire protective clothing. One of the pit crew members will fuel the car, while the other will carry the second fuel delivery canister and an approved fuel overflow catch pan.\n\n\n## Perform the refuel\n\n1. Get into position for the approaching pit stop. Have 1 crew member pick up the first fuel delivery canister. Have a second crew member pick up the second fuel delivery canister and the fuel overflow catch pan.\n2. Attach the first fuel refilling canister. As the race car comes to a stop in the pit, open the door on the refueling port. Insert the nozzle of the first fuel delivery canister into the fuel feed pipe and invert the fuel delivery canister to allow the fuel to flow out. Hold the fuel delivery canister at about a 60-degree angle.\n3. Catch overflow fuel from the first fuel canister. The crew member with the fuel overflow catch pan must set down the fuel delivery canister that was carried out, and place the fuel overflow catch pan to catch fuel overflows.\n4. Attach the second refueling canister. When the first fuel delivery canister is empty, pull it out of the fuel feed pipe and set it down away from the race car. Pick up the second fuel delivery canister, insert the nozzle of the canister into the fuel feed pipe, and invert the canister to a 60-degree angle.\n5. Catch overflow fuel from the second fuel canister. Use the fuel overflow catch pan to catch fuel that overflows.\n6. Complete the fueling. When the second fuel delivery canister is empty, pull it out of the fuel feed pipe. Close the door on the refueling port.\n7. Clear the pit area. The 2 crew members wearing fire protective clothing must take the 2 empty fuel canisters and the fuel overflow catch pan back into the garage area.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to construct a 90 degrees angle using compass and ruler?","response":"Often you are required to construct some angles without using a protractor. The following answer teaches you how to draw a 90 degrees angle using a compass and a ruler.\n\n## At the end of a line segment\n\n1. Mark the vertex of your angle anywhere on the paper. Let us name this point as M.\n2. Draw a ray MN, extending in any direction and of any length. This will be one of the arms of our angle.\n3. Place tip of the compass on point M and draw a circle cutting the ray MN at some point (say P).\n4. Keep the width of the compass the same. Then place its tip on P and draw an arc cutting the circle at some point (say Q).\n5. Keep the width of the compass the same. Place its tip on Q and draw another arc cutting the circle at another point (say R).\n6. Keep the tip of the compass still on Q. Draw another arc somewhere outside the circle. For carrying out this step, you can set the width of the compass to any measure.\n7. Keep the same width of the compass (as set in the previous step). Now place its tip on R and draw another arc which cuts the arc drawn in the previous step at some point (say S).\n8. Connect the points M and S with a straight line. Extend it to form a ray ML. The measure of the angle LMN is 90.\n\n\n## Through the middle of a line segment\n\n1. Draw a straight line. On a piece of paper, draw a line segment of any convenient length. Make it horizontal for the sake of simplicity, but it could be at any angle. Label the line segment AB.\n2. Pick any point on AB. Mark it, and label it O. O can be anywhere on the line segment, including at either end point (A or B). For convenience, let's put O somewhere near the middle of AB. The line segment could now be referred to as AOB.\n3. Grab a compass. Open the compass to a radius a little shorter than either AO or OB. Now place the compass point at O. Strike short arcs through AB on either side of O. The two arcs should have the same radius. Label those two points of intersection C and D. Now the line segment could be referred to as ACODB.\n4. Strike two more arcs. Place the compass point at C, and strike an arc to one side of the line segment. Then place the compass point at D, and strike a second arc of the same radius and on the same side of the line segment. Make sure those two arcs intersect. Call that point of intersection E.\n5. Draw the 90\u00b0 angle. Draw a straight line from E to O. Line segment EO forms a 90\u00b0 angle with line segment AB. It actually forms two 90\u00b0 angles at O. If you were to extend EO beyond AB, you would form four 90\u00b0 angles at O.Note that you can draw a 90\u00b0 angle at either end of line segment AB if you want to (in other words at point A or point B). Simply extend AB beyond A or beyond B, and then follow the above steps. Point A (or point B) would serve as point O in the above instructions. This is essentially the same method featured in How to Construct a Perpendicular Line to a Given Line Through Point on the Line, Method 2.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Math","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make quinoa lasagna?","response":"Quinoa lasagna replaces standard lasagna noodles with quinoa. If you want a meatless version \u2013 which doesn\u2019t require pre-cooking the quinoa or vegetables \u2013 opt for the vegetable lasagna, with mouth-watering mushrooms, spinach and onion in a red sauce. The spinach and chicken version has similar ingredients, but is prepared differently. The quinoa is rinsed, drained and boiled first, and the veggies are sauteed on the stovetop before baking the lasagna. Pair either lasagna with a complimentary beverage, and serve vegetables and dipping bread on the side.\n\n## Bake vegetable lasagna\n\n1. Chop vegetables while the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Use a large chopping knife to dice the mushrooms. Dice the onions more finely than the mushrooms.\n2. Line a greased casserole dish with veggies and quinoa. Spray the dish generously with coconut oil cooking spray. Place the spinach, mushrooms and onions into the dish. Sprinkle the uncooked quinoa on top.\n3. Mix up the marinara in a medium bowl. Combine the marinara sauce with the vegetable broth, cottage and ricotta cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, sea salt and ground pepper. You can use 1% cottage cheese and full-fat ricotta cheese, or opt for whatever type you like of each.\n4. Combine the marinara with the contents of the casserole dish. Pour the marinara mixture over the veggies and quinoa. Mix all of the ingredients together with a large spoon. Ensure that the sauce mixture mostly covers the other ingredients.\n5. Bake the covered casserole for one hour. Cover the dish with tin foil. After 30 minutes, remove the lasagna and stir it. Replace the foil cover and put the dish back in the oven for another 30 minutes. At the halfway mark, it\u2019s normal for the dish to appear a bit watery.\n6. Add the toppings and cook for two minutes. Arrange sliced tomatoes and shredded mozzarella to the top of the lasagna. Replace the tin foil. After cooking, let the dish cool for about ten minutes before serving it.\n7. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store the lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate for up to five days. If freezing, allow the lasagna to cool completely first. Let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. Try a glass pyrex dish for refrigeration. Try a disposable aluminum casserole dish for freezing. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top of the lasagna and push all of the air out before wrapping the whole dish in tin foil.\n\n\n## Make spinach and chicken lasagna\n\n1. Boil the quinoa in a small pot. Add rinsed and drained quinoa to a pot with 1\u00bd cups (350 ml) of water. Bring the contents to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat to low and put a lid on the pot. Continue cooking for about fourteen minutes. Remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for five minutes. Fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork. The quinoa is finished cooking when the liquid has all been absorbed.\n2. Sautee onion, garlic and mushrooms. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Pour in the vegetables. Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onions are translucent.\n3. Cook ground chicken with the veggies. Over low to medium heat, cook the chicken for six to seven minutes in with the onion, garlic and mushroom you just sauteed. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to break up the meat as it cooks, until it is no longer pink.\n4. Add spinach, tomatoes and seasonings. Add spinach to the saucepan and cook it for two minutes, stirring continually, until the spinach leaves wilt. Mix in tomatoes, basil, salt, red pepper, oregano and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about ten minutes, until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat. The mixture must be thick, not runny, for the lasagna to set properly.\n5. Combine quinoa, cheese and sauce as the oven preheats. Preheat the oven to 375 \u00b0F (191 \u00b0C). Add the quinoa, ricotta and 1\/2 cup (95 g) of grated mozzarella into the sauce mixture and fold it in, then mix well. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. You can use a 9\u201d (23 cm) x 13\u201d (33 cm) oven-safe casserole dish.\n6. Add the topping to the lasagna. Smooth the top of the lasagna with a spatula. Sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella on top in a single layer. Pour the Parmesan and breadcrumbs on top.\n7. Bake the lasagna for 30-35 minutes. Allow it to cool for at least five minutes before you serve it. The lasagna is done when the top is bubbling and lightly browned. If you want it browner, you can put it under the boiler for about a minute at the end.\n8. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers. Store your lasagna in an air tight container. Refrigerate the lasagna for up to five days. If you want to freeze it, allow the lasagna to cool entirely first. Allow it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before re-heating. For example, you can refrigerate the lasagna in a glass pyrex dish with a lid. For instance, place the lasagna in a disposable casserole dish. Add a sheet of plastic wrap on top, then push all of the air out. Wrap the entire dish in foil, and freeze.\n\n\n## Compliment quinoa lasagna\n\n1. Serve the lasagna with vegetables. Add chopped fresh basil to the top of the lasagna, or fresh basil leaves on the side of the plate. Serve a tossed salad, steamed vegetables, or roasted vegetables alongside the lasagna. For example, thickly-sliced, cooked zucchini goes well with quinoa lasagna. Serve cooked spinach, or fresh spinach as a side salad. Make sweet potatoes, which go well with quinoa lasagna.\n2. Serve complimentary beverages. Red sauce goes well with a glass of red wine. If you prefer white, opt for something crisp and dry. Other options are non-alcoholic beer, or sparkling water with muddled herbs. Try a red wine from southern Italy, such as from Tuscany. Another option is a light Sicilian red wine. Try a white wine like Pinot Grigio or Verdicchio.\n3. Serve thick, crusty bread with dipping oil on the side. Combine olive oil with lemon juice, grated Parmesan cheese, and dried herbs\/seasonings, to taste. For example, try 1\/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil, a squirt of lemon juice, and a teaspoon (4 g) of Parmesan. Tap out a small sprinkle \u2013 1\/2 teaspoon (2 g) or less \u2013 each of dried basil, parsley, thyme, oregano, black pepper, rosemary, salt, and red pepper. Mix in 1\/2 teaspoon (2 g) of minced garlic, if desired.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Quinoa lasagna is a type of

{"instruction":"How to know what to charge for babysitting?","response":"Babysitting is a great way to earn money and get experience taking care of children, but figuring out how much to charge for your time can be tricky. Many babysitters don\u2019t have much work experience, and they feel bad asking for money. Remember, your time is valuable and you deserve to be paid fairly! Figure out a good base rate by talking with babysitters and parents in your area. You can also use an online babysitting rate calculator. Then charge more based on how many children you\u2019re sitting, their needs, your skills, and your transportation costs.\n\n## Set a base rate\n\n1. Ask other babysitters you know what they charge. If you know anybody else who babysits, ask them what they charge. Once you have multiple opinions, you can see what the average is. Since they live in your area, they\u2019ll know what a reasonable rate is for where you live. Different areas have very different rates, depending on what people\u2019s average income is. Ask a fellow babysitter, \u201cI\u2019m a new babysitter and am trying to figure out what to charge. I was wondering how much you charge per hour?\u201d\n\t* Major cities and their suburbs generally pay higher rates than small towns. In New York City and L.A., sitters charge about $20 an hour, while in Houston and Chicago they charge $15.\n2. Use an online rate calculator. The internet has a lot of babysitting rate calculators that allow you to put in your zip code and how many years of babysitting experience you have. It will calculate the average rate. One example is https:\/\/www.care.com\/babysitting-rates.\n3. Ask parents you know what they pay for babysitters. Ask trusted adults in your area how much they pay their babysitters. This will help you get an idea of how much people are willing to pay. Once you have an idea, propose it to your client, and see if they think it\u2019s fair. Keep in mind that parents will pay more per hour for a qualified nanny than for a teenage babysitter. Parents will also pay differently for full-time babysitting than for occasional nights or weekends.\n4. Look up what the minimum wage is in your area. Too many babysitters settle for less than minimum wage because they\u2019re not sure what it is, or because the job is less official than jobs that require work permits. Counties and cities calculate the minimum wage based on what they think is a fair amount to give someone for an hour of their time, so you should charge at least that. If you\u2019re underage to work at a regular job or are undocumented, you should still ask for the minimum wage. You deserve to be paid fairly.\n\n\n## Increase your base rate\n\n1. Increase your rate when you gain experience and qualifications. The more babysitting experience you have, the more skilled and qualified you are. Also, the older you are, the more you can charge. Increase your rate when you pass big milestones like graduating middle school or high school. Charge more if you have extra skills, like CPR certification or camp counselor experience.\n2. Charge more if there are more children. Once you\u2019ve settled on a reasonable base rate, charge more money (maybe 5 dollars more per hour) for each additional child you\u2019re asked to look after. Watching 1 or 2 children is very different from watching 5 children, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it before saying yes to the job. Also, consider asking your client if you can bring a co-babysitter along with you for large groups of children. The client should pay both babysitters a reasonable rate for this to be a fair deal.\n3. Charge more for special needs and skills. If the child you\u2019re being asked to watch is an infant who requires constant supervision, diaper changing, and bottles, you can charge more than if you\u2019re watching a 10 year old. If the child has special needs or is particularly rambunctious or difficult to manage, you should also charge more, because you will have specialized skills to take care of them. Offer the price you think is fair considering the amount of physical and emotional energy that goes into caring for that child.\n4. Increase your rate if they ask you to do extra chores. You should feel free to charge more if your client asks you to do household chores like sweeping, mopping, dishes, laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking. You can also charge more if they ask you to care for their pets or help their children with their homework. The more tasks they ask you to do outside of just watching their child, the more you can charge for your hourly rate.\n5. Factor in transportation. If you have to travel a long time to get to your babysitting job, you should charge for your commute. Talk to your client about ways to do this. You can include your commute-time in the amount of time you\u2019re compensated for. Another way is to have your client pay for your gas money or your bus tickets, depending on how you are getting there. If you have to bike or walk to your babysitting job in the dark, make sure you feel safe. Otherwise, you should refuse the job, or ask for different hours. Don\u2019t accept a ride from an unfamiliar babysitting client. It may not be safe.\n6. Ask for more payment for babysitting on holidays. If your client asks you to work on Christmas, Valentine\u2019s Day, New Year\u2019s Eve, or some other special occasion, you should charge more. First of all, you\u2019re giving up having a fun time, and you should only do that for the big bucks. And secondly, the client will be willing to pay more, because it\u2019s hard to find sitters on nights like that. On the other hand, if you\u2019re babysitting in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, you\u2019ll probably get less money than babysitting on a Saturday night, when your clients want to go on a date night.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to stretch your quads (quadriceps)?","response":"The quadriceps are a group of four muscles that run down your thighs. Virtually every athletic activity or exercise engages your quads, so it's important for them to be flexible and strong. To maintain healthy quads, stretch them before and after exercise. You can also use yoga to increase the flexibility in your quads, which can make them less prone to injury.\n\n## Warm up your quads\n\n1. Walk or bike for 10 to 15 minutes. A gentle cardio exercise such as walking or biking will get the blood flowing to your quads and make stretching more comfortable. Stretching cold muscles could result in injury. If you're planning on exercising outside in cooler weather, add 5 to 10 minutes to your warm-up time before you start stretching.\n2. Do standing quad stretches before a long run. From a standing position with your knees together, lift one foot and grasp it with your hand. Gently press your foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other foot. This stretch can be done both before and after a long run or other physical activity, as part of your warm-up or cool-down. You can also do this stretch while lying on one side. Brace your core to keep your spine in alignment and help stabilize your pelvis.\n3. Add kneeling stretches to target quads and hip flexors. Kneel on the floor on one knee. You may want to rest your knee on a folded towel or mat. Lean forward slightly, with your other foot flat on the floor and your knees at right angles. Lean forward, contracting your core and the glute of the kneeling leg. As you exhale, shift your body forward to stretch your quad and other hip flexor muscles. You can rest your hands on your front thigh for balance and stability. Hold the stretch for a 15-40 seconds, then switch and repeat the stretch with the other leg. Keep your spine neutral and your upper body posture straight. You also want to avoid arching, rounding, or flattening your lower back or pulling back against the lean.\n4. Use lunges for dynamic stretching. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart and step one foot forward. Lower your body by bending at the knees until the back knee is nearly at the floor. Your front knee should be in line with your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise up and repeat with the other side. You can do a series of lunges where you gradually move forward, or you can stay in the same place. Start with 2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg. If you have trouble balancing and feel wobbly, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to form a T-shape.\n\n\n## Stretch tight or injure quads\n\n1. Use active range of motion exercises to maintain knee mobility. To complete this stretch, bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion, or as far as you can go without discomfort. You can do this stretch while standing, sitting, or lying down. Choose the position that provides you the most stability and allows you to move your knee the most. This stretch is best soon after an injury, when your movement may be at its most limited. Try to complete 10 repetitions with each leg, but don't overdo it. Stop if you feel pain.\n2. Find a partner for passive quad stretches. Either standing, sitting, or reclining, have your partner grasp your ankle or foot. Your partner will slowly bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion. When your knee is fully bent, have them hold the stretch for a few seconds before slowly moving your foot back down. Passive quad stretches are a good way to stretch your quads if you don't have the control needed to do standing quad stretches on your own. If you're able to move on your own, passive quad stretches may be of little benefit to you. Communication is key with passive stretching. Don't let your partner push your leg to the point that you feel pain in the muscle. This could lead to additional tearing or re-injury.\n3. Relieve tightness with the couch stretch. Kneel with one knee on the ground in front of a couch. Brace the foot of your kneeling leg on the side of the couch. Your other leg should be straight out in front of you with your knee at a right angle and your shin perpendicular to the ground. Push your hips backward as you press your raised heel towards your glute. You can place your hands on your front knee for balance. Hold the stretch for a few seconds or breath cycles, then release and repeat the stretch with the other leg. In addition to a couch, you can also use a wall or low bench to lean your foot against.\n4. Increase stability and control with supine squats. You will need a stability ball for this exercise. Sit on the ball, then walk your feet forward as you gradually lean back at the same time. When you are lying face up, roll forward and allow your knees to move over your toes until your knees are fully flexed. Then contract your quads and roll back until your knees are at 90-degree angles. Try to do 10 repetitions of this exercise. Only go as far as you can without pain or discomfort.\n\n\n## Improve quad flexibility\n\n1. Lengthen your quads with the crescent lunge. From a standing position, step one foot forward and fold over so that your hands are on either side of your foot. Your front knee should be at a right angle with your shin perpendicular to the floor. Raise up on an inhale, sweeping your arms out to the side and overhead. Lower your hips and press downward into the lunge, stretching and lengthening your quads. Breathe deeply and hold the lunge for 30 seconds to a minute. To get out of the pose, lower your hands over your front leg and then walk or jump your front leg back to meet the other leg. You can raise your hips into downward facing dog if you like, then walk or jump the other leg to the front and repeat the lunge on the other side.\n2. Lower into hero pose. Kneel on the floor, touching your inner knees together. Your feet should be slightly wider than your hips with the tops of your feet on the floor. Exhale and lower your hips onto the floor between your feet until your buttocks are resting comfortably on the floor. Lean forward slightly as you lower, wedging your thumbs into the backs of your knees. Breathe deeply, feeling the stretch in your quads, for 30 seconds to a minute. Open your shoulders and drop your shoulder blades down alongside your spine. If you can't sit comfortably on the floor in this position, place a block to sit on, or roll up a blanket or towel.\n3. Stretch your thighs and core with bow pose. Lie face-down on your mat with your arms by your sides, palms up. On an exhale, bend your knees and raise your feet towards your buttocks. Reach back and grab either your ankles or the tops of your feet and pull them forward. As you inhale, lift your feet towards the ceiling as you raise your thighs off the floor. Breathing can be difficult in this position, but gaze forward and focus on breathing as deeply as you can. Hold the pose for 20 to 30 seconds, then slowly release to lay back down. You can use a folded blanket to pad your ribs and hips to make the pose more comfortable.\n4. Open your hip flexors with pigeon pose. Start on all fours with your knees below your hips and wrists below your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward to the back of your right wrist as you pull your foot around to the left side. The side of your right shin should be lying on the mat perpendicular to your torso. Then slide your left leg back until it is flat on the floor. Exhale and raise up so you are in a sitting position with your right leg crossed in front of you and your left leg extending backwards. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then return to all fours and repeat with your left leg in front and your right leg extended behind you. There are many variations to this pose. For example, try folding over your front leg and resting your chest and forehead on the mat for a more intense hip opener. For a really deep quad stretch, raise your back foot towards your buttocks. Grab your back foot or ankle with your hand and press it towards your buttocks to further deepen the stretch.\n5. Bend into camel pose. Kneel with your legs about hip-width apart. Inhale and draw your elbows towards each other behind your body, allowing your sternum to lift and your rib cage to expand. Press your hands into your heels, maintaining the lifting in your sternum and keeping your shoulders back. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Avoid tightening your glutes. Camel pose helps lengthen and improve flexibility in your hip flexors and upper quads. If it is too much of a challenge for you to reach your heels, you might place a block between your feet or lean back over an exercise ball.\n6. Extend your backbend with little thunderbolt pose. Once you're comfortable in camel pose, take it a step further by lowering your head until the crown of your head rests between your feet. Reach your arms forward to grasp your lower thighs. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To come out of the pose, engage the core and slowly roll yourself back up to a kneeling position. Keep your glutes soft to avoid excess pressure on your lower back. This pose opens up your hips and quads. The practice of lifting up with your chest as you lower your torso backwards is an intense workout for your thighs.\n7. Rest in child's pose. Still in a kneeling position, spread your knees slightly and bring your big toes together. On an exhale, fold over your thighs, extending your arms out overhead and resting your forehead on the floor. Breathe deeply in this position for as long as you want. In addition to being a relaxing way to end your practice, child's pose also works as a good counter-pose after backbends.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?","response":"Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion\/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication\/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and\/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication\/trisomy versus deletion\/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and\/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and\/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make a rubber band star?","response":"Making a star out of a rubber band is a simple trick that you can use to impress your friends! All you need is a sturdy rubber band a little bit of patience. Once you get a single star down, try making a star within a star to up the ante a bit.\n\n## Create a single star\n\n1. Place a sturdy rubber band over your left thumb and index finger. Put the rubber band near the end of your fingers and stretch your fingers out slightly so the rubber band stays taut. Turn your hand so that your palm is facing you. Choose a rubber band that's not too wide, as wide rubber bands are more difficult to stretch. Also, pick a slightly longer rubber band than normal. There's not a set width and length, but if you're having trouble stretching it around your fingers, it probably won't work.\n2. Lift the band closest to you over the top band and pull the top band out. When holding your palm toward you, you'll see 2 bands. Push your right index finger underneath the first one and hook your finger over the second band, pulling it out. It should go underneath the first band and out toward your palm.\n3. Twist the loop over itself and hook it on your pinkie. Use your right hand to twist the band you just pulled out to the right over itself. It should make a little teardrop-shaped loop that you can hook over your pinkie. You should now have a triangle shape stretched between your index finger, thumb, and pinkie. The rubber band should twist around each finger to make a teardrop-shaped loop, and the triangle should be on the inside edges of your fingers, not the outside.\n4. Reach into your thumb loop to grab the top band with your index finger. Insert your right index finger near the inside of your left thumb in the loop made by the rubber band, going down as you do. Go up through the middle triangle (with the thumb loop over your finger) to grab the band that's between your left index finger and your pinkie. Draw the band out the way you came in, through the thumb loop. You should now have a square in the middle. Keep holding on to the loop you pulled out with your right index finger.\n5. Grab the right side of the band between your 2 index fingers. Insert your right middle finger up through the loop that's over your pinkie. Grab the band that's just to the left and pull it out below. Stretch out your fingers to make the final star! Your right index finger and right middle finger will be holding on to 2 points of the star.\n\n\n## Move to a double star\n\n1. Begin with a single star. To move to a double star, you need to be able to make the single star first. The double star is a continuation of the single star, so get your hands in position with your left index finger, left thumb, left pinkie, right index finger, and right middle finger each holding a point of the star. You will need a long rubber band that's not too wide. You should easily be able to stretch it between 2 hands. However, it should be small enough to maintain tension over 3 fingers on one hand.\n2. Release your pinkie and your left thumb and stretch the triangle over them. Let the loops just pop over the edges of these fingers. As you do, you'll have a triangle shape with a loop over the right index finger and a loop over the middle index finger. Place the right index finger loop over your left thumb and the right middle finger loop over the left pinkie. Pull your right fingers out of the loops.\n3. Grab the bottom of the loop near your index finger. Use your right index finger and middle finger and grab the band the runs directly in front of your left index finger. It's technically the bottom part of the loop going over the index finger. Insert your fingers in it from the top but with your finger pads pointing up.\n4. Pull the bottom loop down and twist it. The loop should end up below the other parts of the rubber band. Twist it over itself to the left, forming a new loop. The loop should currently be over your right index finger and middle finger.\n5. Place your right fingers through the bottom loops. Put your right index finger through the inside of the loop that goes over your thumb.

{"instruction":"How to give dawah?","response":"Giving Dawah \u2014 inviting people who are non-Muslims or drifting away from Islam to Islam \u2014 is an important task and part of practising Amr Bil Ma'ruf Wan-Nahyi Anil-Munkar (calling to good and forbidding the evil). However, the actual job of teaching and preaching Islam is not for the unqualified and uneducated. Proper training and experience is needed to give Dawah. So, how can you effectively and properly give Dawah?\n\n## Prepare yourself to give dawah\n\n1. Make sure you have the right intentions before giving Dawah. You should have pure and good intentions. Oftentimes, many Muslims decide to tell the world about Islam but do it in a way that causes more damage than good, putting themselves in unfortunate situations. Don't give Dawah if your intention is to show off that you are a very knowledgeable person; make sure your intention is to please Allah. Giving Dawah is essentially a special mission to invite people to worship Allah according to the way that He wants to be worshiped. You are delivering a message of truth and showing others how to follow it. The purpose of Dawah is not only to spread the knowledge of Islam but to grow closer to Allah yourself. Take the act of inviting others to Islam as a way to bring yourself closer to Islam as well.\n2. Take a short Dawah course to learn how to give Dawah to a variety of different individuals. You can often find organizations or community groups that come together to teach about Dawah. Most of these courses are free. Some organizations, like Mission Dawah, offer online training or training apps. You can find courses that come in audio, video, or written format for your convenience. Conferences dedicated to teaching how to give Dawah are often held, so be on a lookout in your local area for those. There, you can meet others wishing to give Dawah and learn from educated and experienced teachers and preachers.\n3. Learn how to answer frequently asked questions about Islam. If a Dawah course is not doable for you, there are many materials and resources that talk about common questions people may ask about Islam and how to answer them. Search local Islamic centres for books or the internet to learn what others are asking about Islam. Some questions you might be asked are:\n\t* What is the difference between the words Islam and Muslim? Who is Allah? Who is the Prophet Muhammad? And why do Muslims believe he is the last prophet? What do Muslims believe about Jesus? What does Islam say about homosexuality, abortion, and marriage?\n4. Integrate Islam into your life as much as possible. This means you live and breathe Islam both mentally and physically. You should continue to present yourself as a Muslim as well as bring Islam material into your daily interactions and environments. Maintain the physical appearance of a believer by growing and maintaining a beard and wearing your hijab. Bring Islamic materials to your workplace or where ever you go. This makes giving Dawah easier, as it may spark conversations or questions from others. Bring halal meat to your workplace and share them to others to generate conversations. Pray at your workplace or wherever you are. Let people know prayer is very important to you. You may need to arrange a place or room with your employer and employees in order to pray.\n5. Pray to God and ask for guidance and a sound mind for you to be able to share your faith according to His holy will. For God to answer your prayers, you must live a righteous life and repent any unlawful things you may have done. Truthfulness is one of the most important qualities to have when calling people to Islam. Having this mindset will lead you closer to Allah and also prepare you better for Dawah.\n\n\n## Speak about islam\n\n1. Begin by getting to know the person. Talk to them about themselves, their family, their work, and show that you genuinely care about them. Each person is unique and getting to know them will help you plan the best way to give Dawah to them. Try to find out as much as you can what they know about Islam. Some good opening questions are: How did you first hear about Islam? What do you know about Islam? Or bring up some recent news involving Islam. Do not speak too much about Islam at one time -- let them set the pace. It is best to give Dawah in small doses. Depending on who you are talking to, you can continue the conversation or give literature for them to go through on their own. Giving Dawah is about simplicity. Just be friends with them. Sometimes introducing or reminding someone of the Islam faith is just to be a good friend and show through example. This is especially effective if you know of a Muslim that is straying from Islam.\n2. Ask them if there is anything they do not understand about Islam. You can ask, \"What do you think is wrong with Islam?\" or \"What do you think Islam is?\" Then clear each misconception with as much knowledge and clarity as you can offer. Or point them to the right direction to obtain these answers. Many people will have confused Islam traditions and teachings with ideas that they are already familiar with outside of Islam. For example, people who are familiar with the Christian Bible and its many interpretations may draw the same interpretations when they hear that the Quran mentions Adam and Eve. Some believe that, because of the Bible, society sees women as lesser than men and then have the misconception that women are also oppressed or dominated by men in Islam. Point them towards the Quran and outline the differences between the Quran and the Bible and what these differences mean. In the media and popular culture, many Islamic traditions are the subject of heated debates. The hijab worn by Muslim women is a popular debated topic. You should clarify these misconceptions and lead them to view these concepts of Islam in the framework of Islamic thought which sees the wearing of the hijab as honouring purity of both thought and body.\n3. Say thank you. Thank the person for giving you the chance to share about Islam to them. You might even want to try saying thank you if someone asks you a rude question or insults Islam, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. By saying thank you in response to abusive statements, you show others that Islam is, indeed, a good faith. It may also surprise them and make them more open to listen to you. For example, someone might ask, \"Why do Muslim women cover their heads? Isn't this a sign of subjection of women?\" Tell them, \"Thank you for asking me about my religion\" and continue with \"You have an interesting question concerning Islam and I congratulate you for seeking correct knowledge about our faith.\"\n4. Be polite and don't argue or debate with who you are giving Dawah to. Arguing and debating is against the teachings by Allah in the Quran; \"He who gave up disputing while he is right, a palace of high rank in Paradise will be built for him\" (At Tirmidhi). Although your intentions may be good, arguing could lead to disputes and it is best to spread the knowledge in a peaceful way. In Islam, backing down is better than debating. Stop looking for \"loop holes\" in others' beliefs or putting them down for their beliefs. Belittling others is against the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Be more inviting and less defensive. Being defensive or argumentative pushes people away from Islam. It may also hurt people such as your family or friends and even you, bringing in frustration caused by these disputes. In the end, God knows your intentions and will work his will.\n5. Speak the truth. Islam believes that truthfulness is one of the pillars the world's survival depends on. Since speech or speaking is an exclusive human trait, lying is seen as losing your humanity. So when giving Dawah, not only is it important that you do not lie, but also preach that you cannot lie and the faith of Islam is all about truth. You can give examples from the Quran and Sunnah of what lying means and what its consequences are. Some examples of lying are lying when buying and selling, lying about visions and dreams, telling lies as jokes, or being hypocritical. Allah also warns against speaking about everything you hear as you may hear both truths and lies, and speaking about everything could count as lying. Do not tell lies about Allah and His Messengers: \u201cTelling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.\u201d Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1229. When you make a statement about Islam, justify it and reference the Quran or Hadith if necessary. If you do not know the answer to a question, say \"I don't know\". Don't lie about your knowledge or spread misinformation. The best way to go about this is to be truthful and direct the person to another source that may contain an answer to their question.\n6. Don't worry if non-Muslims do not accept Islam. The purpose of Dawah is not to convert or convince others to Islam. The decision should be made by the person's own free will.You're duty is to convey the message of truth. Allah guides whom He wills. Ask them, even if they do not accept Islam, what they think of Islam now. This can aid you in future attempts at Dawah or even continue the conversation.\n\n\n## Give dawah in other ways\n\n1. Hand out materials such as a CD, book, or brochure of other more experienced Da'ee (caller of Islam). One of the easiest ways to give Dawah is to spread the message through another Da'ee, especially if you are still working on acquiring knowledge. You can also give a translated version of the Quran. The Quran is your most effective tool in telling others about Islam, as it is the most powerful book at your disposal. Give out leaflets or brochures of upcoming conferences to people or to your local Islamic centre. If you plan to do Dawah in public to strangers, giving material is the best way to engage others in conversation.\n2. Do charity work to help others and also show how Islam has affected your life. Get involved in your local area by helping the old or disadvantaged, or with organizations that help with the environment, community, animals, and much more. Engaging in charity work or sadaqah is a very important virtuous deed in Islam and shows Allah and others your faith in Islam. There are no preliminary requirements in order to give sadaqah and you can should give it freely without any limits or expect anything back. People touched by your charity work will most likely have a more open mind about you and Islam. This makes the message of Islam much easier for others to accept.\n3. Provide materials to your Islamic community by recording lectures, or posting videos. This is especially needed if your community is lacking materials to give to members who have strayed from Islam or cannot attend meetings regularly. It will also bring you closer to others in your local community. The Prophet Muhammad encourages that knowledge be shared and not withheld. There will be people in your community that are not willing to share the knowledge. Do non-direct dawah by using the internet. For example, post Islamic tweets on Twitter.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to peel plums?","response":"Peeled plums are perfect for pies, jam, cakes, and baby food. If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don\u2019t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren\u2019t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don\u2019t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won\u2019t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half.

{"instruction":"How to tell if it's an acquaintance, friend, crush, or love?","response":"Feelings and emotions can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when trying to decipher those of someone you know.  Are you simply an acquaintance?  Do they consider you a friend?  Is it love or just a crush? There are many layers to relationships and it's not always clear where you stand with someone.  However, there are several different methods to decode how a person feels about you and perceives your relationship.\n\n## Read body language\n\n1. Notice the amount of eye contact. People\u2019s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they\u2019re feeling toward those around them. Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect. Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later. Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush. Someone who\u2019s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.\n2. Gauge proximity. The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them. Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance. A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it\u2019s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you. People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another.\n3. Monitor movement. Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us. Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they\u2019re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm. Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush. Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.\n4. Pay attention to posture. The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you. A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity. When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally).\n\n\n## Listen for verbal cue\n\n1. Recognize vocal tone. The inflection and quality of a person\u2019s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually. A friend\u2019s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone. A crush\u2019s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity. Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a \u201csing-song\u201d tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease. People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners\u2019. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one.\n2. Think about how casual your conversations are. A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.\n3. Notice how much they talk about themselves. If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to \u201chumble-brag.\u201d They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.\n4. Analyze how intimate your conversations are. If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.\n\n\n## Analyze your relationship\n\n1. Reflect on your relationship. Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:\n\t* How long have you known this person? How frequently do you see or talk to them? Is the communication equitable? What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)? How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?\n2. Make a list. If you\u2019re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a \u201cFriend\/Crush\u201d list. If you\u2019re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a \u201cLike\/Love\u201d list. Like a Pro\/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.\n3. Ask a trusted friend for help. Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.\n\n\n## Ask directly\n\n1. Express your feelings first. If you\u2019re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you\u2019re looking for honesty, you need to show you\u2019re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you\u2019re direct with them. Start with a sentence like, \"I want you to know that I feel\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_about you\/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.\"\n2. Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way. Explain that you\u2019re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It\u2019s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction. Try saying something like, \"I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.\"\n3. Be prepared for the consequences. There\u2019s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to dress for the gym?","response":"When you go to the gym, it's important to wear clothes that are breathable and flexible. It's good to look good \u2013 but remember that fitness and safety are your foremost concerns. Ill-fitting clothing can cause itchy skin, rashes, or more serious injuries. Also, be mindful that your clothes may shift when you're working out. Wear clothing that will facilitate a solid workout.\n\n## Dress for women\n\n1. Choose a lightweight t-shirt or sweatshirt. Wear a breathable material like cotton or polyester. When you work out, you'll grow hot and sweaty, so you want to make sure that your clothing doesn't trap the heat. If possible, choose a top that is specifically designed for wicking sweat. Consider wearing a tank top or sports bra for a more breathable\u2014if more revealing\u2014outfit. If you have large breasts, then a sports bra may be essential for a comfortable gym experience. No matter your size, a bit of extra support never hurts.\n2. Pick your bottoms. Wear something flexible, with an elastic waistband: gym shorts, sweatpants, track pants, or yoga pants. You should be able to perform a full range of leg workouts while you're wearing the bottoms. The bottoms that you wear also depend on the effect that you're going for: tight and skin-showing clothing can help you show off, and baggier, more flowing garments might help you blend in. Short shorts may afford you the most flexibility, but they can also show a lot of skin. If you feel shy in shorts: wear sweats or yoga pants. If you wear shorts, inspect yourself from all angles in a mirror before you go to the gym. Keep in mind that people may be able to see up the leg of your shorts when you're using certain equipment, like the leg press.\n3. Bring appropriate footwear. The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs. Keep in mind that a lot of gyms don't allow open-toed shoes. If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much \u2013 just wear something comfortable that you can stand in. If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.\n\n\n## Dress for men\n\n1. Wear shorts or sweats. Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get. Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees \u2013 especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion. If you decide to wear shorts, be aware that other people may be able to see up the leg of your shorts when you're using machines like the leg press.\n2. Take a breathable, flexible shirt. A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion. A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for.\n3. Choose appropriate footwear. The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs. If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much \u2013 just wear something comfortable that you can stand in. If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.\n\n\n## General advice\n\n1. Wear lightweight, breathable socks. Cotton socks are generally a good choice. Make sure that the socks are neither too tight nor too loose! Wear high socks or low socks, to your taste. Short socks will give your legs more space to breathe, but high socks can be useful for wicking away sweat. Tight socks can constrict your legs and slow your blood circulation. On the other hand, socks that are too loose might distract you by sliding down your legs.\n2. Carry a towel. As you move about the gym, use a soft, clean towel to wipe your sweat away. You don't want to leave your sweat on the seat of a machine! Most gyms provide clean towels for members to use during their workouts. Do not share a towel with anyone, or else you risk sharing germs! Clean up any sweat that you do leave on a machine. Use a small, clean towel to wipe down the seat, the bars, and any other part that your sweat has touched. Your sweat carries bacteria that could infect someone else if left to dry on the machine!\n3. Wash your clothes after the gym. Even your own sweat, when left to dry on fabric, can breed nasty bacteria and then infect you. Odor-making bacteria tend to grow better on polyester than on cotton \u2013 but you should wash all gym clothes regardless.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to kill a fly?","response":"Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can\u2019t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don\u2019t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Flies can be

{"instruction":"How to replace a ceramic tap cartridge?","response":"## Choose a new cartridge and drain the faucet\n\n1. Purchase a cartridge that matches your faucet\u2019s model. The cartridge varies depending on the faucet you have, so getting an identical replacement is important. Order a new cartridge by noting the manufacturer\u2019s name and the faucet\u2019s model number. The name is usually printed somewhere on the faucet handle. The model number can sometimes be found on the faucet as well, such as on a tag tied to the cold water line. The water lines are located underneath the sink for a sink faucet and in the wall for a showerhead. They won\u2019t always be accessible, so look in the owner\u2019s manual for the model number as well. If you are unable to find the information you need to get a replacement, pull the cartridge out first, then take it with you to a hardware store. New cartridges can also be ordered online from the manufacturer.\n2. Turn the water control valve clockwise to shut off the water flow. If you\u2019re replacing a sink faucet, check underneath the sink. Look for a pair of water lines running from the handle, each with its own valve. If that isn\u2019t an option, locate the main shut-off valve in your home instead. It will be on the lowest floor of your home, close to the water heater. If you\u2019re having a hard time finding the valves, follow the water lines. For example, find where the main water line enters your home. Follow it to the water meter and the shut-off valve. The main shut-off valve can vary. It could be a colored wheel that you rotate or a handle that you position horizontally to stop the water flow. It may also be outside of your home.\n3. Open the faucet to release any water still inside it. Go back to the faucet you are replacing and activate it. If the water has been shut off, it won\u2019t shoot out its normal jet of water. Instead, any water trapped in the line will spill out. Wait until the faucet stops gurgling and dripping before attempting to replace the cartridge. Draining the line won\u2019t take long. The lines can\u2019t store much water, so they clear within several seconds.\n4. Cover the drain to prevent anything from falling down it. Faucets have some small screws and other parts that could cause a lot of unnecessary hassle if they were to get lost. To prevent accidents, fit the drain\u2019s plug into place. If it doesn\u2019t have a plug, place a towel over it. Make sure the drain is completely covered. Anything that falls down the drain will be difficult to remove and could damage your plumbing. If you happen to lose a part, order a replacement online or from a hardware store.\n\n\n## Handle a sink faucet\n\n1. Pry off the faucet cap with a flathead screwdriver. The decorative cap is at the very top of the faucet stem. Find the bottom edge of the cap, then slide the tip of the screwdriver underneath it. Push the cap up until it pops off the faucet. If the cap is stuck, pry it at a few different angles. Keep working around the edges until it is loose enough to lift off the faucet. Note that every handle is separate. If your faucet has separate cold and hot water handles, they have their own cartridges. Single-handle faucets only have one cartridge.\n2. Unscrew the handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Check the top of the faucet. There will be a small hole in the center where the cap was. Stick a small Phillips screwdriver into the hole to reach the screw, then turn it counterclockwise until you are able to remove it. Pull the faucet handles off afterward. Some faucets open with an Allen wrench instead. If the screw has a hexagonal opening on top, use an Allen wrench.\n3. Remove the nut on the faucet with a crescent wrench. Removing the handle exposes a circular metal nut on the base of the faucet. Clamp the wrench around the nut, then turn it counterclockwise. Once the nut comes loose, you can finish turning it by hand. Continue rotating it until you\u2019re able to lift it off of the faucet. You could also use pliers to remove the nut. Water pump pliers are designed for dealing with plumbing nuts and bolts, but you may be able to remove it with different tools.\n4. Pull the cartridge out of the faucet by hand. The only thing left in the faucet is the cartridge. It has a wide base with a metal or plastic column in the center. You can use the column to get a grip on the cartridge. Just pull it straight up from the faucet to remove it. The old cartridge can be thrown out in the trash. Cartridges have traditionally been made of brass, recognizable because of its dull yellow coloring. Your faucet may have a silvery cartridge made of chrome or zinc, or a white one made of plastic. If you\u2019re having a hard time holding onto the cartridge, grab it with pliers. Needle nose pliers are great for such delicate work.\n5. Insert the new cartridge into the faucet stem. The new cartridge won\u2019t fit unless it aligns with the stem slot properly. Check the bottom edge of the cartridge for a small tab. The inner part of the faucet stem will have a matching slot. Simply align the tab with the slot and slide the cartridge in to install it. Make sure the new cartridge is properly aligned with the opening so it you don\u2019t inadvertently damage it. Handle it with care!\n6. Reassemble the remaining handle parts to finish the installation. Put the parts back in reverse order. Start with the nut, tightening it by rotating it clockwise with a wrench once it\u2019s on the faucet stem. Place the handle on top of it, inserting and tightening its screw with a Phillips screwdriver. Finish by pressing the cap onto the top of the handle. If your faucet is connected to multiple handles, remember to replace the cartridge in the other handle as well if necessary. Once you have finished, reactivate the water line to test out the new cartridge!\n\n\n## Fix a shower faucet\n\n1. Unscrew the shower handle with a Phillips screwdriver. Rotate the handle until you spot a small opening with a screw inside. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Once the screw is gone, the handle won\u2019t have anything holding it to the wall. Slide it off the wall and set it aside. The cartridge is located behind the handle, so you won\u2019t be able to reach it without removing the handle first. Some shower handles have alternative types of screws. You may need an Allen wrench instead of a Phillips screwdriver.\n2. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the handle adapter. The handle is held in place by a round plate with an adapter in the middle. In the center of the adapter, you will see a screw. Turn the screw counterclockwise until you\u2019re able to remove it. Then, slide the adapter forward to detach it from the faceplate. Sometimes the adapter can be removed by twisting it off. It depends on the model, but, if you don\u2019t see a screw, you most likely have to twist it off. Note that you may need to remove the faceplate in some cases. It usually isn\u2019t necessary, but every cartridge system is a little different. If you don\u2019t see the cartridge, check the faceplate to see if it can be unscrewed too.\n3. Slip off the stem cover and anything else in front of the cartridge. Removing the adapter will reveal a small metal cylinder in the center of the wall opening. However, many shower cartridge systems have a few extra layers of protection around it. Yours may have a white plastic cap, followed by a metal ring. Pull both of them off the cartridge by hand and set them aside. These components are for adjusting and limiting the water temperature. They aren\u2019t present in all faucet models, but save them if you have them.\n4. Use pliers to pull out the clip holding the cartridge in place. Look along the top edge of the cartridge for the clip. It is usually made of steel and situated in a groove on the cartridge. Reach in with a pair of needle nose pliers, then lift it to pop it out of the slot. Pull it toward you to remove it, then dispose of it in the trash. Some faucets have a nut instead of a clip. If you see a ring around the cartridge but no clip, use pliers or a wrench to turn the nut counterclockwise. Once it comes loose, slide it off the wall.\n5. Remove the cartridge by gripping it with a pair of pliers. Once everything else is out of the way, the cartridge isn\u2019t tough to remove. Grip the stem, then attempt to pull it toward you. If it doesn\u2019t come out right away, take a closer look at it. Some cartridges have to be rotated slightly to align with a slot in the wall before they can be removed. The cartridge is recognizable because of its column-like stem jutting out from the wall. The cartridge\u2019s base is round and fits inside the wall opening. The cartridge is usually made of brass, which has a yellow coloring. Some cartridges are made of silvery steel or white plastic instead.\n6. Install the new cartridge by aligning it with the wall opening. Check the cartridge stem to see if it has a notch on it. If the notch is present, align it with the groove in the wall slot. Then, slide the cartridge in with pliers or a wrench. Make sure it is plugged all the way in before putting anything else on top of it. If the new cartridge came with a packet of grease, rub it onto the cartridge before putting it back. The grease protects the cartridge from damage during the installation. You could also apply your own plumber\u2019s grease to it.\n7. Replace the remaining parts to finish the installation. Replace the parts one by one in reverse order from how you took them out. Start with the retaining clip or nut, tightening it after putting it back. Return any stem coverings next, followed by the screw-on handle adapter. When you\u2019re done, add the handle and screw it into place. Test the faucet afterward. If it doesn\u2019t seem to be working the way you want, check all of the parts to ensure they are undamaged and have been put back correctly.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to be a lazy college student?","response":"In college, unlike in high school, you are expected to take responsibility for your own learning.  It is ultimately up to you to determine how much time and effort you want to put into your schoolwork. Experts suggest that college students today work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts did in 1961.  But there is also evidence that working more hours is not necessarily the best way to be productive. A little laziness may even be good for us.\n\n## Part 1 of 3: prioritize what's important\n\n1. Ask yourself what you want from college. There are many reasons why a college degree is desirable, not least that it is still considered highly valuable by many employers. Your own reasons for pursuing a college degree may be more personal, but spend some time working out exactly what these reasons are. Consider why college is important to you. Do you want to learn important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving? Do you want to make friends, network and get to know other people? Do you want to get good grades for further study? Do you want to get a particular job that requires a college degree? Spend some time reflecting on these questions and come up with your own answers. It might even be a good idea to write them down. This will help you to recognize what's important to you so that you can focus on the essential things.\n2. Select your major and your classes carefully. After you have determined what's important to you as a college student, then you can make better decisions about pursuing a major or particular class that will help you achieve your goals. Speak to your academic advisor. It is their job to provide information about what certain majors entail and what courses are necessary. Ask other students for information about the class. Ask questions like, is the course time-consuming? Is the professor fair? What are the assignments like? If you don't know any other students, look online. There are many websites, some more general and others specific to particular schools where students share this kind of information. Be aware that what is on these sites are merely individual opinions, and your own experience of the course may be different.\n3. Complete as much coursework as you can before the semester gets going. Preparation is key and doing what you can before the semester starts will help things run more smoothly later on. For example, ask the professor for a copy of the syllabus ahead of time so that you can order the necessary materials before the semester starts. Familiarize yourself with the course materials. You can even start reading early to get ahead!\n4. Figure out what is actually required to do well in the class. This is key to being a lazy, yet productive, college student. Professors often cut material from the syllabus as the class goes on. Usually, the syllabus contains more material than it is possible to get through in a single semester. Ask your professor what is required reading and what materials or course readings may be more supplementary, i.e. they will not appear on exams or in assignments. Pay attention to what kinds of materials come up most frequently in lectures. For example, there may be a textbook chapter and several articles assigned for each class, yet the professor usually focuses on the textbook chapters in lecture. If you can determine a pattern then you can use this in your own preparation for the class.\n5. Streamline your commitments. Being a college student is not simply about going to class, many students are also part of sports teams, fraternities\/ sororities, student associations and take on other voluntary roles. These are obviously important and worthwhile activities, but ask yourself if there are any commitments you could scale back on. Identify particular commitments that are not necessary to the goals that you have chosen to focus on. Accept that you can't do everything.\n\n\n## Part 2 of 3: make the most of your time\n\n1. Get things done at the right time. Timing is essential to being a lazy college student. While procrastination can be appealing, there are some activities that are best done at certain times. Here are some examples. Do your homework straight after class when the content is fresh in your mind. This will save you time as you won't have to re-visit the material at a later date when you might have forgotten it. Write out an essay plan or outline immediately after discussing it with the teaching assistant or professor in office hours. Again, if you spend some time getting your ideas on paper at the right moment then you'll save yourself time in the future because you won't have to worry about all the good ideas you might have forgotten.\n2. Take good notes. At some point, you will have to engage with the course materials. If you take good notes the first time around, then at the end of the semester or when an assignment is due you can use these notes and avoid having to re-visit what you have already read. Write good summaries. Try to distill the argument of a text or the main points in a chapter into a single paragraph. This will serve you well when you come back to look at your notes. Figure out if typing notes works best for you or if you prefer to write them long-hand. Annotate and highlight the text. Use sticky notes to mark important parts.\n3. Learn how to read quickly. Most college courses require you to read a high volume of complex material. Learning to read quickly and effectively is one of the key skills you learn in college. Preview the passage before you start reading it. Take a minute or two to look at the title, the headings or subheadings, any pictures, charts or graphs. Skim over the passage by reading the first and last paragraph, and the first sentence of every paragraph. Researchers suggest that these techniques improves reading comprehension, which will ultimately save you time as you already begin reading with a sense of what's important in the passage. Read in the right environment so that you actually take in what you are reading. This will prevent wasting time by re-reading certain parts that you missed. This requires good lighting, a comfortable upright reading position, minimal distraction and regular breaks.\n4. Utilize \"dead\" time. This refers to the hours in the day spent in routine, non-productive tasks. The idea is that focusing on these key moments can actually give you more free time to relax and be lazy. For example, those 30 minutes spent staring out the bus window during your daily commute could be utilized for productive tasks like reading over your notes or listening to the lecture that you recorded. If you have free time in between classes, go to the library or the nearest cafe and spend the time studying.\n\n\n## Part 3 of 3: learn other ways to work efficiently\n\n1. Take advantage of college resources. Colleges often provide writing centers and tutoring services to their students. It is a good idea to make use of these services as they will help you get the work done faster and prevent you wasting time being stuck on a particular problem or difficult assignment.\n2. Form a study group. Collaborating with other students in study groups can be an excellent way to share the workload. When prepping for the final exam, delegate different topics to different members of the study group to make notes on. This can be a great time saver, although you will obviously still need to make sure that you are familiar with all the course content. Make sure everyone in the study group is on the same page and shares the work equally.\n3. Seek help from your professor. Remember there is no shame in getting help when you need it. Most professors and teaching assistants have weekly office hours. They can help you strategize for success in the class. Get advice on assignments and exam preparation, often this will prevent you wasting time on what isn't essential to the course.\n4. Get the right technology. There is lots of technology that can help you as a college student, a laptop being the most obvious investment. Consider investing in a recording device. This can prove useful especially if you have difficulty concentrating in lecture or are going to miss a key class. Always remember to ask the professor for permission before you record them! Use software to help with referencing and citations. Many college papers, especially research papers, require correctly formatted references and bibliographies. There are many programs available to help with this, which will ultimately save you time and avoid any issues with incorrect citations.\n5. Work on managing stress. College can be stressful, for many students it is the first time living away from home and there are increasing financial pressures on students, many of whom work to sustain themselves throughout college. Acknowledge that stress is normal, but be aware that too much time spent worrying or stressing can be unhealthy and stop you from succeeding. Engage with your college's resources for managing stress. Many colleges provide programming for students to help with stress management, especially during finals period. Some key ways to manage stress are to engage in physical exercise, make time for relaxing activities, and try to get enough sleep. When it comes to managing stress, being lazy sometimes can be a good thing!\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make ricotta cheese?","response":"Ricotta cheese, the delicious key ingredient in Italian dishes from lasagna to cannoli, is simple to make in your own kitchen. Homemade ricotta cheese requires just a few ingredients, and the result is lighter and fresher than store-bought cheese. See Step 1 and beyond to learn how to make a batch today.\n\n## Milk-based ricotta\n\n1. Prepare the strainer. Line the fine-mesh strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth, and set it over the nonreactive bowl. Set this contraption on your work surface so to have it ready for the cheese mixture. If you don't use cheesecloth, it will be difficult to separate the cheese curds from the whey. You can substitute a double layer of paper towels or a thin cotton dishcloth in a pinch.\n2. Heat the milk, cream and salt. Place the milk, cream and salt in the saucepan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Allow it to heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. When the mixture is hot enough, turn off the heat and move the saucepan so the milk can begin to cool. It should take about 5 minutes to reach the correct temperature. Stir the mixture as it's heating to prevent it from scorching on the bottom. Use your candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to determine whether the mixture has reached the right temperature. If you don't let it cook long enough, the curds won't separate from the whey. If you overcook it, the texture will be ruined.\n3. Slowly add the vinegar. Use one hand to stir constantly while the other hand slowly pours the vinegar into the heated milk and cream mixture. The vinegar will cause the curds to coagulate and separate from the whey. You'll see solid bits forming and floating to the top of the liquid. Keep stirring until all of the vinegar has been added. The curdling agent in this case is vinegar, but some people prefer to use other substances. Try substituting 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice for a different flavor. For a more traditional touch, try using animal rennet as your coagulant. Mix 1 teaspoon of rennet with 1\/4 cup of cold water, then stir it into the milk mixture.\n4. Let the mixture sit until it's thick. Wait about 10 - 20 minutes for the coagulant to go to work and cause the curds to separate from the whey. It's ready when the curds have floated to the top to form a thick layer, leaving the liquid whey underneath.\n5. Ladle the curds into the strainer. Scoop out the thick top layer of curds and ladle them over the cheesecloth-covered strainer. Keep ladling out the curds until all that's left in the saucepan is the whey. You can discard the whey at this point.\n6. Let the ricotta drain. Wait at least an hour for the last of the whey to drain from the ricotta through the cheesecloth into the bowl. It will take about half an hour for the ricotta to fully drain. Don't attempt to stir it or push it through the cheesecloth, as this will just push the curds into the cloth. If you'd like a creamier final product, stop draining the ricotta after 5 - 10 minutes. For a drier final product, wait an hour for it to drain.\n7. Spoon the ricotta into a bowl. The finished ricotta is now ready to use in your favorite recipe. It's delicious as part of a savory dish or a dessert. Ricotta will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\n\n\n## Whey-based ricotta\n\n1. Save the whey from making cheese in a non-reactive pot. When you make homemade cheese, you'll have curds at the bottom of the pot, and you'll pour off the whey. Filter as many of the curd particles out as you can since they would otherwise form tough \"beads\" in the final ricotta. Cover the whey and let it sit for at least 12 hours at room temperature to develop sufficient acidity. Acidified whey acts as its own coagulant, making it unnecessary to add vinegar or lemon juice to separate the curds.\n2. Heat the acidified whey. Pour it into a saucepan and heat it while stirring, taking care to avoid sticking or burning. Heat until the temperature has risen to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and a white appears on the surface. Continue heating and stirring until the temperature reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Note that the foam will build up somewhat. Be careful. If it boils, it can boil over.\n3. Remove the whey from heat and wait for it to curdle. Cover it and allow it to cool undisturbed until comfortable to the touch. The curds will soon appear like clouds suspended in the whey, while the whey will be clear and yellowish green.\n4. Strain the ricotta. Do not stir up the curd. Instead, set up a receiving pot with a large strainer and a fine clean cloth on top. Ladle the curds into the cloth, leaving the whey in the saucepan. Discard the whey. Be sure to scoop out the curds gently. Because the curds are very fine and delicate, they can stop up the cloth easily. This will cause very slow draining if they are broken up.\n5. Drain the whey through the cloth. It can take 2-3 hours for the whey to completely drain. If you prefer, you can set the strainer in the refrigerator and let it drain overnight.\n6.

{"instruction":"How to cook corn?","response":"There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Corn on the cob can be boiled.","max_prob":3.7108969688,"ccp":-0.6309174707},{"claim":"Corn

{"instruction":"How to confuse cleverbot?","response":"Cleverbot is an online program that uses complex coding to hold text-based conversations with human readers. Though Cleverbot is great at holding basic conversations, it isn't perfect. With a little trickery, it's not terribly hard to get Cleverbot to reveal the limits of its programming. Whether you're trying to administer the Turing Test (a test used to tell whether an artificial intelligence can \"pass\" as a human) or simply looking for some easy laughs, visit Cleverbot.com to get started!\n\n## Confuse cleverbot with specific trick\n\n1. Try typing in song lyrics. Compared to other computer programs, Cleverbot is an exceptionally skilled conversationalist. However, Cleverbot knows nothing of the joys of music. If you try typing in a few lines of your favorite song lyrics, most of the time, Cleverbot will interpret the lyrics literally or give a nonsensical response, even if the lyrics are well-known. Note, however, that for certain songs that are very well-known, Cleverbot actually can (and will) recite the song lyrics if you start typing them in. For instance, try typing in the opening lyrics to Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\": \"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?\"\n2. Present Cleverbot with a logical paradox. A paradox is a statement, question, or idea that has an answer that can't be logically found. Since some of history's greatest thinkers have struggled to untangle logical paradoxes, it's a very safe bet that Cleverbot will be completely perplexed by most of them. In addition, Cleverbot doesn't even do well talking about subjects that have the potential to be paradoxical, like time travel. Try using some of the paradoxes below, or use a search engine to find your own \u2014 there are literally hundreds out there. \u201cIf this statement is true, then Santa Claus is real.\u201d\n\t* \"Since we haven't been visited by people from the future, does that mean that time travel will never be possible?\" \"What would happen if Pinocchio were to say, \"My nose will grow right now?\"\n3. Ask Cleverbot to play games with you. Cleverbot isn't terribly playful. For instance, if you ask it to join you in a game of chess or checkers, it'll say \"OK\", but then if you say, \"You go first,\" you'll get a nonsensical response. This is probably due to the fact that Cleverbot doesn't really have the capacity to play games \u2014 it knows to say that it wants to play chess with you, but it has no idea how to actually play chess. Cleverbot can, however, play rock paper scissors. Try it \u2014 say \"Let's play rock paper scissors\" and then say either \"Rock\", \"Paper\", or \"Scissors\".\n4. Type a sappy romantic dialog for Cleverbot. Sooner or later, almost everyone casually messing around with Cleverbot will get the idea to jokingly express the love or attraction they feel towards it. Though Cleverbot can handle basic overtures of love like \"I love you\" and \"Marry me\", it's not so good at interpreting subtle romantic comments or come-ons. For people nursing a crush on Cleverbot, a direct approach is apparently best. Give it a shot \u2014 try feeding Cleverbot pickup lines like \"I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?\" The response you get will usually be a little confused (at best) (if you use the library card line, you'll get \"I can say anything.\")\n5. Ask Cleverbot to do math problems. You might think that, because it's a computer program, Cleverbot would be able to do math problems almost instantly. In fact, for some reason, Cleverbot is terrible at doing math, even when the problems you ask it are very simple. It shouldn't take you long to get a confused response out of Cleverbot with this strategy. Sometimes, you'll even get different responses if you switch between using numerals and spelling each number out. For instance, asking \"What is 200 times 2?\" gets you the answer \"4,\" while asking \"What is two hundred times two?\" gets you the answer, \"A number.\"\n6. Talk to Cleverbot about supernatural things. Cleverbot doesn't have good old-fashioned human common sense, so it doesn't have a good grasp on what's real and what's not. Talking to Cleverbot about monsters, aliens, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena is likely to confuse it. You can also confuse it by bringing up some religious or spiritual topics, even if they're quite well-known. You can even use the subjects of modern-day ghost stories to the same effect. For instance, if you say, \"Have you ever been visited by Slenderman? \", Cleverbot will respond with, \"My life is a lie?!\"\n7. Talk to Cleverbot about famous people. Cleverbot knows nothing about politics or celebrity gossip. Asking Cleverbot about its opinion on a famous person or public figure will almost always confuse it. For example, asking, \"What do you think about Brad Pitt?\" will get the answer, \"I think he si (sic) a great president, he'll change the states.\" You may also want to try talking about the different things famous people have done \u2014 Cleverbot isn't terribly smart about these things either. For instance, typing in \"What do you think about the president's social policies?\" will get you: \"I think he isn't the president anymore.\"\n8. Talk to Cleverbot about other websites. Cleverbot does not understand other websites and will respond with something weird. Try talking about wikiHow and see what happens.\n\n\n## Confuse cleverbot with general strategies\n\n1. Talk with a lot of emotion. Cleverbot doesn't have a great grasp of the emotional context that is necessary to understand human communication. It will usually take everything you say literally. Because of this, Cleverbot isn't too \"clever\" when it comes to emotional questions and outbursts. Try typing a furious, rambling insult or tearfully asking for Cleverbot's forgiveness for some imagined slight \u2014 usually, its response won't make much sense.\n2. Talk in gibberish. One sure-fire way to get Cleverbot's wires crossed is to send it messages that don't make sense to humans, either. Typing in gibberish, either by purposefully misspelling words, making up new words, or just mashing randomly on the keyboard, can get some funny results. For instance, try the sample messages below:\n\t* \"Asuerycbasuircanys\" (random gibberish)\n\t* \"What is your opinion on the tornalions in reffriddo?\" (made-up words)\n\t* \"Wut arr ewe dewing laiter this eavning?\" (misspelled words)\n3. Use a lot of slang. Cleverbot doesn't have the common sense to be able to piece together sentences that use slang \u2014 especially modern slang. Using lots of colloquialisms and \"street\" lingo in your messages can usually get Cleverbot's metaphorical head to spin. The more slang you use, the better, as even literal-minded Cleverbot can usually figure out simple sentences like \"What's up, dog?\" Try getting started with one of these examples:\n\t* \"h0w 4r3 y0u d01n6, cl3v3rb07?\" (1337speak)\n\t* \"Yo, what's up, bro? Lemme ask you a question, broseph - how are you doing today, broheim?\" (Bro-y slang)\n\t* \"Well, pardner, it's about time we saddle up, hit that old dusty trail, and high-tail it out of here.\" (Cowboy slang)\n4. Use long messages. The longer and more complex the things you send to Cleverbot are, the less likely it will be to respond correctly. Typing out rambling, meandering messages (or even entire conversations) can get some pretty funny responses out of Cleverbot. Don't be afraid to stop one sentence and begin another \u2014 periods, question marks, and exclamation points are allowed in the middle of your message. For instance, you might want to have the same sort of long, aimless chat you might have when you're catching up with a friend. For instance, you might try: \"Cleverbot, how are you? I was just thinking about you. I hope you're doing well. I had a great weekend - I went hiking up on Castle Rock on Saturday. Beautiful views from the top. Have you ever been up there? We should go sometime. Anyway, I just wanted to know what you were up to.\"\n5. Keep your conversation going for a long time. The longer you follow a certain line of questioning, the more likely Cleverbot is to \"crack\". By the time you're ten or twelve messages into a conversation, Cleverbot has forgotten what you were originally talking about and is simply responding literally to each message as best as it can. This can lead to some pretty bizarre conversations, especially if Cleverbot misunderstands something you type. You may want to try using the \"Think For Me!\" button on Cleverbot.com for this. This button makes Cleverbot think up a response to its own message for you. Since Cleverbot is basically communicating with itself, using this button can quickly cause the conversation to devolve into nonsense, even if you only use it a few times.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Cleverbot is an online program.","max_prob":21.9136867523,"ccp":-0.0002481737},{"claim":"Cleverbot uses

{"instruction":"How to decorate an above ground pool?","response":"Above ground pools are a modern, easy-to-install alternative to traditional underground pools. If you want to blend your above ground pool in with the rest of your yard, decorating it is a great way to start. With a few natural and practical decorations, like plants or a pool chairs, you can make your above ground pool a stylish part of your backyard. For siding options, you can install a deck, concrete or wood paneling, or glass panels.\n\n## Add natural decorations\n\n1. Set up potted plants as botanical decorations. Adding potted plants around your above ground pool can help it blend in with the rest of your backyard. If you install a deck, position a few potted plants around the sides or around the bottom of the pool. You can also grow trees or shrubs around the above ground pool as a long-term alternative.\n2. Add tiki torches to brighten up the area surrounding your pool. Tiki torches are a popular way to give your above ground pool an outdoorsy touch. Stake the tiki torches in the ground surrounding the pool at an even distance from each other, positioning them upright to prevent them from tilting. You can buy tiki torches online, from a garden center, or at many home improvement stores. String lights around the tiki torches for cheap and stylish lighting while swimming at night.\n3. Use straw bales if you want a rustic siding. Straw bales can make a cheap, natural siding for above ground pools. Stack the straw bales around the sides to approximately halfway up the above ground pool's height to use as a decoration and partial step into the pool. You can buy straw bales from some agricultural supply stores or plant nurseries. To keep the straw out of the pool, do not stack the straw bales to the full height of the pool.\n\n\n## Choose practical decorations\n\n1. Set up a cover to use as shade. Put up an umbrella, trellis, or pergola over the pool during summer months or in hot, sunny climates. If you have any naturally shady areas in your yard, construct the pool near these areas as an alternative. A cover decoration can help keep your pool cooler and prevent those who use it from getting sunburned.\n2. Add cushions or chairs as seating near the pool. Seats are perfect for tired swimmers who need a quick rest. Set up a few lawn chairs, waterproof cushions, hammocks, or other seats below the pool or on the deck (if applicable) for easy access after you swim. You can buy pool chairs from some home decor stores or online.\n3. Put up a foldable cover over the top to keep your pool safe and clean. To prevent debris from getting inside the pool and accidents with children or pets, buy a foldable pool cover online or from a pool supply store. Use the foldable cover overnight or while going on vacations where you won't be able to routinely clean the pool. Pool covers are also useful during winter or off-season months if you don't want to drain it.\n4. Install a table near your pool for towels, snacks, and drinks. If you use your pool for lounging, use a table as a makeshift \"poolside bar\" or coffee table. Set the table up near the edge of your pool or deck, depending on your pool's siding. Unless you set your table up on the deck, choose a table with a similar height as your above ground pool.\n5. Set up lights or heat lamps around the pool for added illumination and warmth. If you plan to use your pool at night, position a few outdoor lamps surrounding the pool. For those in cold climates or who use their pool in the winter, choose heat lamps to stay warm while swimming.\n6. Fence your pool in to separate it from the rest of your yard. A fence can help your pool feel enclosed and keep pets or young children out. Measure the perimeter of your yard and put up a fence around the entire area with a gate near the entrance.\n\n\n## Build deck and side\n\n1. Install a deck around your pool's side for a more finished look. To help your pool blend in with the surrounding backyard, build a deck around the sides that is approximately level with the pool. You can build the deck yourself or hire a contractor to build it for you. Building a deck around the pool is the best way to give it the appearance of an underground pool. If you prefer, you can install a deck with wide sides around the above ground pool and set up chairs or other pool furniture\n2. Set up concrete siding around the pool to secure it in place. For a more urban look, mix a batch of concrete and set up a wall on each side of the pool. If you have experience working with concrete, you can do it yourself. If not, you can hire a landscaper instead. Concrete is sturdy and more weather-resistant than wood but isn't as natural looking.\n3. Try wood paneling as a simpler alternative to building a deck. If you like the rustic look of decks but don't want to commit to the cost or time, line up wood panels around the sides of the pool. Secure the panels in place with an outdoor wood adhesive and apply a sealant to protect it from UV rays and harsh weather. For water-resistant wood stains, try polyurethane varnish, exterior paint, or Danish oil. Wood paneling can give the above ground pool a more finished appearance without as much construction as decks.\n4. Set up glass panes around the edges for a finished look. To give your above ground pool a look similar to a below ground pool, try setting up glass paneling. Buy or cut glass panes the approximate width of your above ground pool and hire a contractor to fix them on top of the siding. Setting up glass panels works best with deck siding.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to deal with a bipolar person?","response":"## Help someone with bipolar disorder\n\n1. Watch for symptoms. If the person has already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then you may know all about the symptoms of this condition already. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of mania and depression. During manic phases, someone may seem to have boundless energy and during depressive phases, that same person might not get out of bed for days. Manic phases may be characterized by high levels of optimism or irritability, unrealistic ideas about one\u2019s abilities, feeling energetic despite getting little sleep, speaking rapidly and going quickly from one idea to the next, not being able to concentrate, making impulsive or poor decisions, and even hallucinating. Depressive phases are characterized by hopelessness, sadness, emptiness, irritability, losing interest in things, fatigue, lack of concentration, appetite changes, weight changes, difficulty sleeping, feeling worthless or guilty, and considering suicide.\n2. Consider the differences in bipolar disorder types. Bipolar disorder is divided into four subtypes. These definitions can help mental health practitioners to identify the disorder whether the symptoms are mild or severe. The four subtypes are:\n\t* \n\t* Bipolar I Disorder. This subtype is characterized by manic episodes that last for seven days or that are severe enough that the person needs hospitalization. These episodes are followed by depressive episodes that last at least two weeks. Bipolar II Disorder. This subtype is characterized by depressive episodes followed by mild manic episodes, but these episodes are not severe enough to warrant hospitalization. Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS). This subtype is when someone has symptoms of bipolar disorder, but they do not meet the criteria for a bipolar I or II diagnosis. Cyclothymia. This subtype is when someone has had symptoms of bipolar disorder for two years, but the symptoms are mild.\n3. Communicate your concerns. If you think that someone may be suffering from bipolar disorder, then you should say something. When you approach the person, make sure that you do so from a standpoint of concern and not judgment. Remember that bipolar disorder is a mental illness and the person cannot control their behaviors. Try saying something like, \u201cI care about you and I have noticed that you have been struggling lately. I want to you to know that I am here for you and I want to help.\u201d\n4. Offer to listen. Someone with bipolar disorder may feel comforted by having someone who is willing to listen to how they are feeling. Make sure that the person knows that you are happy to listen if they want to talk. When you listen, do not judge the person or try to solve their problems. Just listen and offer some genuine encouragement. For example, you might say something like, \u201cIt sounds like you have been having a really hard time. I don\u2019t know how you feel, but I care about you and I want to help you.\u201d\n5. Make a doctor\u2019s appointment. The person may be incapable of making an appointment for themselves due to the symptoms of bipolar disorder, so one way that you can help is by offering to make a doctor\u2019s appointment. If the person is resistant to the idea of seeking help for the disorder, then do not try to force them. Instead, you may consider making an appointment for your the person to have a general health check-up and see if the person feels compelled to ask the doctor about the symptoms they have been having.\n6. Encourage the person to take prescribed medications. If the person has been prescribed medications to help control their bipolar symptoms, then make sure that they take those medications. It is common for people with bipolar disorder to stop taking their medications because they feel better or because they miss having manic phases. Remind the person that the medications are necessary and that stopping them may make things worse.\n7. Try to be patient. Even though there may be some improvement in the person\u2019s bipolar disorder after a few months of treatment, recovering from bipolar disorder can take years. There may also be setbacks along the way, so try to be patient with your the person as they recover.\n8. Take time for yourself. Supporting someone who has bipolar disorder can take a large toll on you, so make sure that you take time for yourself. Make sure that you have some time away from the person every day. For example, you might go to an exercise class, meet a friend for coffee, or read a book. You may also consider seeking counseling to help you deal with the stress and emotional strain of supporting someone with bipolar disorder.\n\n\n## Deal with mania\n\n1. Be a calming presence. During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may become over stimulated or irritated by long conversations or certain topics. Try to talk to the person in a calming way and avoid engaging in an argument or lengthy discussion about something. Try not to bring up anything that might trigger the person\u2019s mania. For example, you might want to avoid asking about something that is stressful for the individual or a goal that the person has been trying to accomplish. Instead, talk about the weather, a TV show, or something else that is unlikely to stress the person.\n2. Encourage the person to get lots of rest. During a manic phase, the person may feel like they only need a few hours of sleep to feel rested. However, not getting enough sleep may make matters worse. Try to encourage the person to sleep as much as possible at night and to take naps during the day if needed.\n3. Go for walks. Taking walks with your the person during manic episodes can be a good way to help them use excess energy and provide a good opportunity for the two of you to talk as well. Try to invite the person to go on a walk with you once per day or at least a few times per week. Regular exercise can also help when someone is having symptoms of depression, so try to encourage exercise no matter what the person\u2019s mood is like.\n4. Watch for impulsive behavior. During manic episodes, the person may be prone to impulsive behavior such as drug use, shopping in excess, or going on a long trip. Try to encourage the person to think a bit longer before making any major purchases or starting a new project when they are in the midst of a manic episode. If overspending is often an issue, then you might encourage the person to leave credit cards and extra cash at home when these episodes strike. If drinking or using drugs seems to intensify the situation, then you might encourage the person to avoid using alcohol or other substances.\n5. Try not to take comments personally. When someone is in the middle of a manic period, they may say hurtful things or try to start arguments with you. Try not to take these comments personally and do not engage in arguments with the person. Remind yourself that these comments are due to the illness and do not represent how the person really feels.\n\n\n## Deal with depression\n\n1. Suggest working towards a small goal. During a depressive episode, it may be hard for the person to accomplish large goals, so setting small manageable goals may help. Accomplishing a small goal may also help the person feel better. For example, if the person is complaining that she needs to clean her whole house, then you might suggest just tackling something small like a coat closet or bathroom.\n2. Encourage positive strategies for dealing with depression. When someone is depressed, it may be tempting to turn to negative coping mechanisms, such as alcohol, isolating oneself, or not taking medications. Instead, try to encourage the person to use positive coping mechanisms. For example, you can suggest calling their therapist, doing a little exercise, or engaging in a hobby when a depressive mood strikes.\n3. Provide genuine encouragement. Encouraging the person during depressive phases will help them to know that someone there cares. Make sure that you avoid making promises or relying on clich\u00e9s when you encourage your friend or the person. For example, don\u2019t say, \u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all in your head,\u201d or \u201cWhen life give you lemons, make lemonade!\u201d\n\t* Instead, say things like, \u201cI care about you,\u201d \u201cI am here for you,\u201d \u201cYou are a good person and I am happy that you are in my life.\u201d\n4. Try to establish a routine. During depressive phases, the person may prefer to stay in bed, isolate themselves, or just watch TV all day. Do your best to help the person establish a daily routine so that they always have something to do. For example, you might establish a time for your the person to get up and shower, a time to go get the mail, a time to take a walk, and time to do something fun, like reading a book or playing a game.\n5. Watch for signs that the person may be suicidal. During depressive phases, people are more prone to thoughts of suicide. Make sure that you take any comments about suicide seriously. If the person is acting suicidal or indicating that they have plans to kill themselves and\/or harm others, then call emergency services for help. Do not try to deal with someone who is suicidal or violent on your own.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to treat arthritis in horses?","response":"Arthritis is a painful joint problem that affects horses as well as humans. If your four-legged friend is suffering from the problem, supplements and medications can provide some relief from painful inflammation. Making lifestyle changes, like light exercise and farrier work, can also increase your horse\u2019s comfort and quality of life. Since arthritis is almost impossible to stop, it is important to keep in touch with a veterinarian for advice on continued treatment.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Consult your veterinarian. A vet will need to examine your horse and assess the factors that might be contributing to its arthritis, including age, diet, and activity level. This will help them determine the right medication and lifestyle changes to prescribe your horse. Your vet may take x-rays to assess the severity of your horse\u2019s arthritis and make further suggestions for treatment.\n2. Control the horse\u2019s weight. If your horse is overweight, this will put additional strain on its joints, worsening pain and discomfort. Help your horse lower its weight, if necessary, then feed it a nutritious but lean diet to keep its weight down. Keeping an older horse nourished can be difficult because their nutritional needs and ability to digest food may change. Always ask your vet for advice before making major changes in your horse\u2019s diet.\n3. Don\u2019t keep your horse confined to the stable. Arthritic horses will probably be reluctant or unable to move like they once did. Keeping them indoors, however, will actually make the problem worse. Provide a large pasture for them to roam and graze about to keep the joints moving and prevent the horse from getting too stiff.Regular light exercise, such as trail riding, will be good for your horse, and limit the effects of arthritis.\n4. Talk to your farrier. The condition of a horse\u2019s hooves and shoes are critical to its movement and comfort, and this is especially the case for one suffering from arthritis. Let your farrier know that the horse is having problems with arthritis, and they may make recommendations that will keep its hooves in good condition and make it more comfortable.\n\n\n## Try supplement and medications\n\n1. Give your horse feed supplements. A number of nutritional supplements are available, including glucosamine and hyaluronic acid. These can be given to your horse along with its food to help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis, like pain and stiffness. Look for feed supplements at a supply store, or ask your vet. Feed supplements are a simple option to try at first. However, they are not regulated, and they are not guaranteed to be effective. Ask your vet what they recommend for your horse based on the severity of your horse's issues\n2. Try injectable joint products. Some products, including polysulfated glycosaminoglycans (Adequan) and sodium hyaluronate (Legend) can be injected directly into the affected joint to give your horse some relief. A vet may also recommend injecting the joint with steroids or hyaluronic acid. These products can give immediate relief. In some cases, their benefits can last for months or years. Your vet will sterilize the area to be injected and inject the correct steroid and acid combination. Once you go down the road of injecting a joint, you will likely have to inject the same joint again in the future to keep your horse comfortable.\n3. Ask about joint projectants. Arthritis is caused by a combination of inflammation and degeneration (breaking down) at affected joints. In addition to the products that provide relief from painful inflammation, ones like glucosamine and chondroitin can help protect the joint itself from damage. Your vet can prescribe the right product for your horse.\n4. Supply pain relievers. Some products, including phenylbutazone and firocoxib, won\u2019t treat the joint itself, but will provide your horse with some general pain relief. Your vet will prescribe these for your horse if they believe the medicine will improve the horse\u2019s quality of life. Use painkillers as directed by your veterinarian. Giving pain medication more frequently than recommended or in too large a quantity can damage your horse\u2019s gastrointestinal tract and cause kidney or liver failure.\n5. Expect the issue to progress over time. Medications can definitely help a horse be more comfortable, and caring well for your horse can increase its quality of life. However, it is almost impossible to repair the damage caused by arthritis. Over time, problems caused by arthritis will increase, so it is important to stay in touch with your vet about continued treatment.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to get a special needs child through airport security?","response":"Travelling with children is always a challenge, as you need to navigate everything from noisy crowds to boredom to hunger. These difficulties may be even more pronounced with a disabled child. However, with some planning and careful consideration, you can stop or mitigate many potential problems, and get through the airport with minimal difficulty.\n\n## Before get to security\n\n1. Consider any problems that your child may have. Every disability is different, so of course, every disabled child will have different problems. Your child may have a physical disability and require some help getting through security, or they may have a developmental disability such as autism and be hypersensitive to noises and being touched. Make a list of the issues your child might have when getting through airport security. For example, if your child was distracted or overwhelmed, would they be the type to either wander or run away, or would they have a meltdown if put into an uncomfortable situation? If your child is old enough to understand what's happening and is aware of what problems they already have, try asking them what they think would cause them trouble at the airport. A child with sensory issues, for example, may say that they'd become overwhelmed by all the new stimulus and end up having severe trouble getting through security on their own. If you've traveled long distances with your child before, even if it wasn't by plane, consider any issues your child had in the past. For example, if you went on a long car trip with your child and stopped somewhere for a break, did they get upset by all the people there?\n2. Contact the airport ahead of time. Some travelers with disabilities find it useful to notify the airport, so that they can arrange any assistance ahead of time. This step is optional, and can depend on the type of your child's disability. If you do contact the airport, though, try to contact them at least 72 hours beforehand.\n3. Talk to your child about airport security. If they know what will happen, they are more likely to stay calm and be comfortable with the process. Library books, social stories, movies, and personal anecdotes can help describe the process. Try to find child-friendly material that has photos or illustrations of airport security. That way, they can visualize what they will experience.\n4. Explain that additional screenings might happen. Sometimes, people get randomly selected to go through additional security. Tell them how it works, so that if it happens, they know that it's normal and okay.\n5. Pack comfort objects in easily-accessible areas. Try placing them at the top of a backpack or bag, or in a separate pocket of a personal bag. Non-liquid snacks, such as pretzels or crackers, should also be easy to reach. Consider stim toys as well. Any comfort objects will need to be scanned. They may need to let it go through the scanner, or the personnel may let them carry it with them, depending on the object. If it goes through the scanner with your bags, explain that the comfort object is having an adventure in the tunnel, and they'll come out the other side soon.\n6. Bring plenty of things to do in the airport and airplane. Arriving early will help, so you may be waiting at the terminal for some time. Consider coloring books, phone games, picture books, chapter books, videos, and more. Make sure that the activity isn't something noisy that would disturb others, though; leave extremely loud toys at home if possible, and lower the volume on a child's electronic toys or give them headphones to plug into that toy. Download several movies or videos onto a tablet on the day before. Start early, in case they download slowly. Older children may be able to entertain themselves with laptops. There are also adult coloring books they can use. Bring chargers for any devices. Some waiting areas have charging stations, so you might be able to charge electronics before your flight.\n7. Pack sensory items for a hypersensitive child. Earplugs, sunglasses, headphones (noise-canceling or otherwise), hoodies, weighted lap pads, and stim toys can help with an overwhelming environment. Encourage your child to be proactive and stim a lot; it's better to be overly cautious than have a screaming meltdown or shutdown. Encourage your child to avoid disruptive stims at the airport. Make sure they understand that things like flapping, rocking, and so forth are okay, but that it might be better to avoid louder or more movement-oriented stims such as echolalia, spinning, or pacing. Stimming in and of itself isn't bad for your child to do, but it's important to avoid disrupting other people or slowing down their process of getting through security when doing so.\n\n\n## Go through security\n\n1. Arrive at the airport early. You do not want to be rushing through every airport procedure; this is likely to upset your child, and stress you out. A general rule of most airports is that you should allow yourself at least two hours to get through security; depending on your child, you may want to arrive earlier than that. Make sure your child has things to do during the ride there. Some airports, such as LAX, can take a long time to commute to. You don't want a bored child sitting in the car while you're driving.\n2. Expect your child's abilities to waver. With the stress and crowds, your child may have a hard time, and not be as capable as they usually are. Your child may move more slowly, struggle with skills like talking or self-calming, and temporarily \"revert\" to younger behavior (especially if they have a developmental disability). Be patient, and accommodate your child's extra needs. Remember, this is temporary, and they'll go back to normal once they can unwind. They aren't doing it on purpose. Be especially careful if your child is epileptic and is prone to seizures. Sometimes, the stress and excitement of the airport can cause your child to have a seizure.\n3. Keep your child in the loop. Since airports are likely new to your child, it's important to make sure your child understands what's going on. Explain each step as it comes up. Preparing a picture schedule may be useful.\n4. Consider taking the family through the special needs TSA line. Many airports have a short line for passengers with disabilities, so there is less waiting involved. Also, it makes it clear that your family might need some extra patience and assistance.\n5. Make sure your child is occupied in lines. Oftentimes, you'll need to wait in long lines to get to airport security, unless you're able to access a security pre-check line. If you can't use a pre-check line, you're going to need to make sure that your child doesn't get bored, overstimulated, or wander off while waiting.\n6. Alert the TSA officers of your child's disability. Once you've arrived at airport security, it's important to let the TSA officers know that you are traveling with a disabled child, especially if it's not immediately obvious (e.g. your child is physically disabled, but doesn't use a wheelchair or walking device). Talk to the TSA officers that are there and discuss how to best help your child through airport security. Some examples of disability accommodation are:\n\t* Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (autism, Down Syndrome, etc.) can be permitted to stay with the person or people they're traveling with, rather than getting separated. Blind or visually impaired children can be assisted through security. Deaf and hard of hearing children do not have to remove hearing aids or cochlear implants, and can proceed through security like normal. Physically disabled children that require a device to move around will not be removed from their device. For example, if your child is in a wheelchair, TSA agents will not lift the child out of their chair to get them through security. A child with a prosthetic limb can get a private screening of their prosthetic if necessary, or have the prosthetic removed and put through the X-ray machine. However, you should only remove the prosthetic if your child is okay with it. In the case of any disabled child, you may be permitted to carry your child through security if it will make the process easier on your child. However, this may only be feasible with smaller, lighter children. Be sure to let the agents know if your child has a special device for their disability that may set off the metal detector.\n7. Understand that your child may have to go through additional screening. Sometimes, things don't go as planned, and your child will need to undergo more screening. This can include a pat-down, which can be very upsetting to some disabled children. If you're permitted to, stay with your child during the process, and ask the TSA agent to warn your child of anything they're going to do in language that's possible for your child to understand.\n8. Make sure child has list of any medications, and a letter signed by a doctor. Put this list with child's medications in a small tote bag with a zipper, in the same bag. The medications must also be in a plastic ziplock sealed bag. Medications are often not questioned if they are in pill form.\n9. Carry a necklace with an I.D. tag or medical bracelet around the child and have them wear that so it is visible for the attendant to see. This can help cut out all the unnecessary verbal explanations about your child. You can also inform the officers, but the less the better when it comes to airline officials. If they have a shirt about their disability, like \"Autistic Cutie!\" or \"Diva with Down Syndrome,\" have them wear it. Script a quick explanation, such as \"My daughter has Down Syndrome and can be frightened in crowds and new situations. Holding her bunny helps keep her calm.\"\n10. Make it clear who is looking after the child. If there are several adults in the group, you don't want each person to think that someone else is looking after the child. It can help to explicitly assign someone to the child for each leg of the trip. One teen or adult should walk at the back of the group, to make sure that no one lags too far behind and gets lost.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to change a diaper?","response":"Changing diapers is often a source of dread, fear, and humor for new parents and caregivers. Babies and toddlers who are not potty trained need to have their diapers changed every few hours to avoid rashes and discomfort. Create a diaper changing station so you can easily change disposable or cloth diapers at a moment's notice.\n\n## Remove the diaper and clean the baby\n\n1. Wash your hands. Before you change the diaper, wash your hands with soapy water. If you don't have access to a sink, you can rub hand sanitizer on your hands. If you don't have hand sanitizer, you can rub a clean baby wipe on your hands. If you work in a daycare, put on disposable gloves after washing your hands.\n2. Prepare the clean diaper. Place the baby on the changing surface and get out a new diaper. If you're using a disposable diaper, unfold it. If you're using a cloth diaper, fold it or stuff it with an absorbent insert depending on the style of diaper you have. Set the diaper to the side so it's ready once you've removed the dirty diaper. Many people place the clean diaper directly under the dirty diaper before you remove it, to catch any accidents that occur during changing. Just keep in mind, the clean diaper can get dirty, so you may need to use a second one if that happens.\n3. Unfasten and remove the dirty diaper. Pull away the tabs, snaps, or Velcro from the dirty diaper to unfasten it. Pull down the front part of the dirty diaper and gently lift the baby's legs up a little. If the diaper is wet, slide the back of the dirty diaper out from under the baby's bottom. If there is poop, use the front half of the dirty diaper to scoop as much of it off the baby as you can. Set the dirty diaper aside until you can fold it. Hold the baby\u2019s legs in one hand so that their bottom is in the air to avoid letting it touch the diapering surface. Ensure that you put the dirty diaper out of the baby's reach. If you\u2019re changing a baby boy who pees during diaper changes, consider laying a clean cloth or baby wipe over his penis while you change him.\n4. Wipe the baby's bottom with a wipe or a damp cloth. Take a baby wipe or damp cloth and wipe the baby's genitals from front to back (towards the bottom). Cleaning is important to prevent bacterial infections. To clean poop, you'll probably need several wipes to ensure the baby is clean. Gently lift your baby's legs by the ankles and wipe in between the baby's bottom. Ensure that there's no poop around the baby's genitals or along the creases of their thighs.\n5. Air dry the skin for a moment. You can prevent diaper rashes by keeping your baby's bottom clean and dry. Give the baby's bottom a few seconds to dry out before you put on the clean diaper. If your baby has a rash, apply diaper cream or petroleum jelly before you put the new diaper on. If you're using cloth diapers, you'll need to lay a disposable insert in the center of the diaper. The insert will keep the diaper cream from touching the cloth diaper which could damage it.\n\n\n## Put on the clean disposable diaper\n\n1. Lay the clean diaper under the baby. Grab the opened clean diaper and lay the back half of it underneath the baby. The diaper should be near the baby's waist. If you're changing a boy's diaper, point his penis down to direct any urine into the new diaper. Pull the front half of the clean diaper up onto the baby's stomach. Ensure that your baby doesn't bunch their legs or the diaper might be uncomfortable. Try to spread the baby's legs so the diaper will fit comfortably. If you're changing a newborn diaper, use a newborn diaper that leaves room for the umbilical cord stump. Or fold over the front of the diaper so you don't cover it.\n2. Fasten the diaper. Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to pull the tabs on each side of the diaper and fold them up towards the front. Fasten them onto the diaper so the diaper is secured to the baby. Avoid fastening the diaper too tightly. Check to see if the diaper is too tight. If it is, the skin will look pinched or red. You should also ensure that the tabs aren't sticking to the baby's skin.\n3. Dress the baby and throw away the disposable diaper. Pull the onesie down and snap it closed or put the baby in a new outfit. Set the baby in a safe place while you fold the dirty disposable diaper. Throw it in the trash or in the odor-sealing canister. To fold the dirty diaper, fold the front part of the dirty diaper in half towards the back of the diaper to make a slight ball shape. Fasten both of the tabs in the center of the diaper to contain it.\n4. Wash your hands. If you are wearing gloves, remove and dispose of them. Then, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. Aim to scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Rinse them thoroughly, then dry them off.\n\n\n## Put on and handle cloth diapers\n\n1. Position the clean diaper under the baby. Take the prepared cloth diaper and lay the back half of it underneath your baby so it's near your baby's waist. If you're changing a boy's diaper, you can prevent leaks by pointing his penis down. Grab the front half of the diaper and pull it up onto the baby's stomach. Spread the baby's legs so the diaper won't bunch while you're fastening it. If you're changing a newborn diaper, ensure that you're using the smallest cloth diapers. You'll probably need to fold them specially so they don't rub against the umbilical cord stump.\n2. Secure the diaper. Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to hook a T-shaped fastener or a two-pronged fastener onto the front of the diaper. Some cloth diapers use snaps that you simply snap into place or Velcro that you can just pull and press down on. Dress the baby before you handle the dirty cloth diaper. If you're using diaper pins, put a few of your fingers under the diaper and above the baby's skin to so you don't accidentally poke the baby.\n3. Store the dirty cloth diaper. If you're handling a poopy diaper, take it to the bathroom and dump as much of the poop into the toilet as possible. You can use a diaper sprayer to remove larger amounts of poop. Place the dirty diaper and any dirty cloth wipes into a diaper pail or hanging wet bag. Wash the cloth diapers according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you're changing a poopy diaper from an exclusively breastfed baby, you don't need to dump the poop in the diaper. It will dissolve in the washing machine.\n4. Clean your hands. Remove your gloves and throw them away, if applicable. Wash your hands using antibacterial soap and warm, running water for at least 20 seconds. After thoroughly rinsing your hands, dry them off.\n\n\n## Gather diaper supply\n\n1. Choose an area to change your baby's diaper. Set up 1-2 diaper changing spaces in easy-to-access spaces in your home. For example, you could set up a changing table in the nursery, your bedroom, or near a bathroom. If you don't want to use a changing table, you can easily change the baby's diaper on a comfortable flat surface (like a bed or on the floor). Choose convenient diaper changing areas based on where your family spends the most time. It's a good idea to pack a diaper bag or backpack with some diapering supplies. Keep the diaper bag in the changing area so you can stock it and then grab the bag when you need to leave the house.\n2. Organize the changing area. You might need more than just a diaper and some wipes to change the baby. Keep things organized and easy to find by using dividers, containers, and small baskets. This way you know right where something is if you need it quickly. For example, it will help to have a drawer or basket that has extra pajamas or pacifiers if your baby needs a change in the middle of the night.\n3. Stock up on diapers and wipes. Newborn babies can go through 8 to 10 diapers a day, so keep a lot of clean ones nearby. They should be easy to reach so you don't have to step away from your baby during the diaper change. You'll also need to keep wipes nearby to wipe your baby's bottom. If you're constantly refilling the diapers at your diaper changing station, consider leaving a new box of diapers in the same room. This way, you'll never be completely out.\n4. Store diaper cream or petroleum jelly. Babies frequently get rashes and you might need to apply diaper cream or petroleum jelly. Keep tubes of these at your diaper changing area so you can easily use them when you notice a rash. It's also a good idea to keep these in your diaper bag so you can treat your baby's rash when you're out together.\n5. Have a place to put soiled diapers. Decide how you'd like to dispose of or handle the soiled diapers. For example, if you're using disposable diapers, set up a trash can or odor-sealing canister. If you're using cloth diapers, you may want to set up a wet pail where you can store the diapers until you're ready to wash them. It's a good idea to keep hand sanitizer nearby to quickly clean your hands before you wash them in the bathroom. Remember to keep the hand sanitizer out of your baby's reach.\n6. Keep distractions nearby. As the baby gets older, you'll need to distract them during diaper changes. Distracting the baby with a toy, object, or book will also keep the baby from grabbing soiled diapers or squirming during the diaper change. Consider keeping some of these near your diaper changing station:\n\t* Small board books\n\t* Pacifiers\n\t* Toy keys\n\t* Rattles\n7. Store changes of clothing and extra sheets. If your baby has leaked through their diaper, you'll need to have a change of clothes close by. Keep several clean onesies at the changing area just in case. You should also have a few sets of clean crib sheets in case these get dirty. If your changing table has a soft, removable cover, you should also have an extra clean cover in case the baby gets the cover dirty during the diaper change.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to drill at an angle?","response":"Drilling at an angle can seem difficult, but don't worry, there's several methods you can use to create angled holes. You can try some basic tricks if you don't need your angles to be too exact. Otherwise, try building an angled jig with a piece of wood for your hand drill, or creating an angled jig that fits onto the plate of your drill press.\n\n## Use basic trick for imprecise angle\n\n1. Use a speed square to gauge your angle for quick drill jobs. A speed square is a right-triangle shaped tool that has angles marked along the hypotenuse (the long side). Use the angles on the edge to guide your drilling. Set the speed square right next to the hole you're drilling. Line up the drill so the top is along the flat side of the speed square. It will almost look like you're drilling into the right angle. Line up the angle markings on the hypotenuse with the center line down the top of the drill. Drill down into the wood at that angle.\n2. Cut a guide from scrap wood to keep the same angle for several holes. Measure the angle you need on a flat piece of scrap wood that's at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut the wood at that angle using a hand saw or radial saw. To cut the wood at an angle, mark the angle along the edge. Use a handsaw to go along that angle. If you're using a radial saw, set it to the angle you need before cutting. Set the wood down where you need to drill. Lay the drill along the angle, and use the wood to guide the drill while pushing into the wood. Make sure to hold on tight to the guiding piece of wood while drilling.\n3. Start with pilot holes to create angled pocket holes. Another option is to drill straight down into the wood to create small pilot holes. You only need to go down about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm). Pull the drill out. Start drilling again with the drill angled straight down into the pilot holes you've created, and then tilt it to the angle you need as you go in the hole. Pocket holes are what you use to connect 2 pieces of wood at an angle. The angle doesn't need to be precise, so you don't need to measure it. Aim for about a 45\u00b0 angle, and you should be fine. This method helps keep the drill bit from breaking.\n\n\n## Employ an angle jig\n\n1. Create your own angled jig with a piece of wood. Make this tool using a radial saw and a scrap piece of wood. Use a radial saw and set it to the angle of the hole that you need to drill into your wood. For example, if you need it set to 30 degrees, then set the radial saw to 30 degrees. \"Jig\" literally just means something that holds your work or guides your tools. Use your radial saw to cut the wood at an angle.\n2. Add a pilot hole to the angled jig by drilling into the angled edge. Drill into the angled part of the wood so that the drill is perpendicular to the wood. This will create the perfect angle for drilling into other pieces of wood. Drill all the way through the wood to make the pilot hole.\n3. Position the wood on your workbench to drill. Place the piece of wood that you need to drill into on your workbench. Put the angled jig over the flat piece. You should see the pilot hole you drilled in the angled part. Clamp the jig into place on top of the other piece of wood. If the jig isn't flat along the top, you can saw off the top edge to make it flat. Then you'll be able to clamp it to the other piece of wood.\n4. Drill through the jig into the wood below to create holes in your project. Next, place the drill bit through the pilot hole. Start drilling, using the pilot hole as a guide. Push down into the piece underneath, creating an angled hole. Once you know how deep you want to go for each pilot hole you're creating in your project, apply a stop collar to the drill to keep yourself from going deeper. The stop collar goes over the drill bit at the place you want to stop. A stop collar is a little metal ring that you can buy at any home improvement store. Move the jig around to each spot you need to drill a hole.\n\n\n## Create an angle jig for a drill press\n\n1. Cut a piece of plywood to fit your drill press plate. Use a table saw to cut the piece down to size, making it perfectly rectangular. It should fit easily on top of your drill press plate, though keep it mind you will angle it up towards the drill. You can trace the drill press plate to get an idea for the size you'll need. You can use scrap plywood for this project, but it should be sturdy enough so that it doesn't bend when you're drilling down towards it.\n2. Add a fence to the front of the piece of plywood. Screw a small piece of wood onto the front of the plywood. The front is whatever part will be facing up on the drill press plate. The wood should be almost the length of the plywood and 0.5 to 1 in (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. When looking at the plywood as you face the drill press, this piece should run from top to bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the left edge. Some fences also run from left to right 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) from the bottom instead. A fence helps you keep your project in place.\n3. Screw a piece of wood to the back of the plywood to create the angle. The bracing piece of wood should be 1 in (2.5 cm) wide or so, but the height of the wood to the press plate will be determined by the angle you want. Measure the angle, and cut the piece of wood so that it will prop the plywood up to that angle. For instance, if you want a 45\u00b0 angle, the piece you cut for the back would need to be taller than if you wanted a 30\u00ad\u00b0 angle. Screw down from the front part of the plywood into the back brace. Use at least 1 screw on each end to hold it in place.\n4. Brace the jig against a piece of clamped wood. Clamp a long piece of wood to the back of the drill press plate. Attach c-clamps on each end. Now you can push the jig up against this piece of wood so it doesn't slide around.\n5. Drill your holes into your project. Place your project piece on the jig up against the fence. Bring the drill down and drill holes into the piece where you need them. If your piece is moving around too much, clamp it into place against the fence. Now you can drill the same angle each time with precision.\n6. Adjust the jig as needed. You don't need to make a new jig for each angle you need. Rather, just add an extra piece of wood to the back brace to extend the length. Overlap the 2 pieces of wood, and tightly clamp them into place on each end. Measure to see if you have the angle you need by placing a speed square alongside it. If you don't have the correct angle, unclamp the extra piece of wood. Adjust the wood and clamp it back into place.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Drilling at an angle can seem

{"instruction":"How to do the charleston?","response":"The Charleston is a medium- to fast-tempo dance that originated in the 20s. It was renowned for being the first social dance one could do without a partner. There are several versions of Charleston, the most popular being the 20s and 30s Charleston. The Charleston is a highly adaptable move that can be incorporated into a wide variety of dances, but the basic movement is the same.\n\n## Master the basic move\n\n1. Take a rock step back with your left foot. Touching the front of your foot to the floor, but not bringing your heel down. Don\u2019t fully shift your weight to this foot. When doing the Charleston, lean forward slightly and bend your knees a little. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet. A rock step, also called a break step, refers to a rocking step in which one\u2019s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot before being returned to the first. The only time when you might begin with your right foot is if you are following a partner. When two people dance the Charleston together, the leader starts by stepping back on the left foot, while the follower starts by stepping back on the right, mirroring the leader.\n2. Step back forward with your left foot. It should now be a step ahead of your right foot. This time, shift your weight to your left foot.\n3. Take another rock step forward with your right foot. Put the heel of your foot on the ground without bringing your whole foot down. Your weight should end up on your left foot still.\n4. Step back with your right foot. It should now be a step behind your left foot. Shift your weight back onto your right foot.\n5. Swing your arms as you step. As you move, your arms should be swinging. This may happen automatically, especially if you\u2019ve seen people do the Charleston before and know what it\u2019s supposed to look like. When your left foot is in front of you, your right arm should swing forward. When your right foot is in front of you, your left arm should swing forward.\n6. Repeat this movement. It probably won\u2019t look terribly impressive on its own, but the back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston. Practice until it feels natural. Then you\u2019ll be ready to start mixing things up.\n\n\n## Do the 20s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Twist your feet in and out. Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again.\n3. Lift your elbows as you swing your arms. This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body. Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle. The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.\n4. Pivot your knees in and out. One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move. Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now. Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #\\*Repeat this move a few times.\n\n\n## Do the 30s charleston\n\n1. Get comfortable with the basic move. All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.\n2. Replace a normal step with a kick step. This will add a little pep to the move. Instead of simply stepping forward, bring your knee up and kick your foot out. Your knee should come up first, propelling your foot forward a moment later. If you would not be transferring your weight to that foot anyway for this step, just swing it back again without letting it touch the ground. Otherwise, plant it back on the ground after the kick.\n3. Add a hitch as you move your leg back. Instead of simply stepping back after a kick, incorporate a hitch into the movement. Bring your knee back up, so that your upper leg is parallel to the ground, before kicking your foot back again.\n4. Touch the ground with your hand. This adds slightly more difficulty and flare. As your leg swings back and the ball of your foot touches the ground, lean forward and tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The Charleston is a dance.","max_prob":12.0739555359,"ccp":-0.0020171367},{"claim":"The Charleston has a medium tempo.","max_prob":25.79114151,"ccp":-0.0000006778},{"claim":"The Charleston has a fast tempo.","max_prob":13.5623950958,"ccp":-0.0016995661},{"claim":"The Charleston originated in the 1920s.","max_prob":20.1382637024,"ccp":-0.0000591603},{"claim":"It was renowned.","max_prob":12.3009433746,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"It was the first social dance one could do without a partner.","max_prob":33.987449646,"ccp":-0.2098175533},{"claim":"There are several versions of Charleston.","max_prob":10.1353416443,"ccp":-0.7336355324},{"claim":"The most popular versions of Charleston are the 20s Charleston and the 30s Charleston.","max_prob":25.6155204773,"ccp":-0.0207187486},{"claim":"The Charleston is a highly adaptable move.","max_prob":23.0516910553,"ccp":-0.6795641173},{"claim":"The Charleston can be incorporated into a wide variety of dances.","max_prob":12.0308828354,"ccp":-0.7910150201},{"claim":"The basic movement of the Charleston is the same.","max_prob":11.9405260086,"ccp":-0.9251032274},{"claim":"A rock step is also called a break step.","max_prob":10.4176988602,"ccp":-0.0145587944},{"claim":"A rock step refers to a rocking step.","max_prob":18.8866233826,"ccp":-0.0742543485},{"claim":"In a rock step, one\u2019s weight is very briefly transferred to another foot.","max_prob":24.7812213898,"ccp":-0.0081469078},{"claim":"Two people can dance the Charleston together.","max_prob":9.5206308365,"ccp":-0.1139361227},{"claim":"The leader in the Charleston starts by stepping back on the left foot.","max_prob":14.0664634705,"ccp":-0.3695201395},{"claim":"The follower in the Charleston starts by stepping back on the right foot.","max_prob":2.6255903244,"ccp":-0.6293911207},{"claim":"The follower's movement mirrors the leader's movement.","max_prob":5.2896285057,"ccp":-0.6526999274},{"claim":"You are moving.","max_prob":2.8358697891,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"Your arms should be swinging.","max_prob":6.082195282,"ccp":-0.7924767967},{"claim":"The back, forward, forward, back motion is the building block for every variation on the Charleston.","max_prob":35.3225250244,"ccp":-0.0044151571},{"claim":"All variations of the Charleston include the basic step.","max_prob":8.1815004349,"ccp":-0.195066056},{"claim":"The basic step is a starting point for the variations of the Charleston.","max_prob":10.0464706421,"ccp":-0.1690198511},{"claim":"Your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body.","max_prob":15.8290205002,"ccp":-0.4451008212},{"claim":"Your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body.","max_prob":6.5478239059,"ccp":-0.3008516608},{"claim":"Your arms should be bent.","max_prob":5.5009274483,"ccp":-0.1723962626},{"claim":"The angle at which your arms should be bent is about 90 degrees.","max_prob":11.4639749527,"ccp":-0.1500456296},{"claim":"The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height.","max_prob":18.9269618988,"ccp":-0.0509155351},{"claim":"The forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.","max_prob":10.22768116,"ccp":-0.8442937687},{"claim":"There is a dance move associated with the Charleston.","max_prob":12.5518445969,"ccp":-0.7445581697},{"claim":"The move involves opening and closing your knees.","max_prob":10.4425792694,"ccp":-0.1561383433},{"claim":"The move involves crossing and uncrossing your arms.","max_prob":15.2681627274,"ccp":-0.1493329857},{"claim":"The knees and arms movements occur at the same time.","max_prob":25.0095252991,"ccp":-0.1961086845},{"claim":"Your knees are bent.","max_prob":5.839723587,"ccp":-0.2929361756},{"claim":"Your knees are touching each other.","max_prob":11.9931898117,"ccp":-0.2929361756},{"claim":"Your arms are crossed over your knees.","max_prob":9.5251874924,"ccp":-0.1561982019},{"claim":"Your right hand is on your left knee.","max_prob":6.2734622955,"ccp":-0.0859748634},{"claim":"You spread your knees apart.","max_prob":1.1077902317,"ccp":-0.9091845052},{"claim":"You uncross your arms.","max_prob":0.6154558659,"ccp":-0.6530931295},{"claim":"Your left hand is on your left knee.","max_prob":3.5838449001,"ccp":-0.0752641404},{"claim":"Your right hand is on your right knee.","max_prob":0.2726692855,"ccp":-0.9662725987},{"claim":"Your leg swings back.","max_prob":6.279112339,"ccp":-0.6596730387},{"claim":"The ball of your foot touches the ground.","max_prob":8.6023902893,"ccp":-0.0712309331},{"claim":"You lean forward.","max_prob":6.3551793098,"ccp":-0.0451656561},{"claim":"You tap the ground with the tips of the fingers of your opposite hand.","max_prob":17.3206119537,"ccp":-0.0729940751}]}
{"instruction":"How to be happy in an unhappy marriage?","response":"People remain in unhappy marriages for many reasons. If you're one of those people, you may feel like you can't be happy. Nonetheless, you can find your own way to happiness, even in a bad situation, by practicing habits that lead to happiness, and you may even be able to work on your marriage to move toward happiness as a couple.\n\n## Learn to be happy\n\n1. Find ways to be grateful. It's not always easy to be grateful, especially in the midst of a bad relationship. Nonetheless, gratitude can help you cope with the bad relationship, and it can lead to you being happier. Take time each day to figure out what you are thankful for. Try writing a few things you are grateful for each day in a journal. You can also use posts on social media for this purpose. Usually, even if the situation is bad, you can find something to be grateful about. For instance, you may not like how you are being treated in the relationship you are in, but you may be grateful to have financial stability in your life at the moment. Alternatively, maybe you're grateful that the other person in the relationship remains a good parent to your kids.\n2. Engage in flow experiences. Flow moments are when you lose yourself to an experience by being completely absorbed in whatever it is you're doing. If you're an artist, a writer, or even a runner, you may already understand this type of experience. It's that moment when the world falls away, and you are just experiencing or enjoying what you're doing. Studies have shown that the more flow moments you have, the happier you are in general. Choose an activity that challenges you a little bit, but that is still familiar so that you can lose yourself in it. For example, if you enjoy painting landscapes, then you might try painting a new subject such as a portrait or a basket of fruit.\n3. Stop fighting the same fights. That is, if you always find yourself arguing about the same things, it may be time to put that topic aside. You need to decide that you won't discuss it because you can't agree or try to find a compromise that works for both of you. For example, if you tend to fight over politics, then you might want to make politics an off-limits topic. Or, if you often fight about what movie you are going to watch on Friday nights, then you might want to take turns choosing the movie.\n4. Develop your own interests. If your marriage is not what you want it to be, it may be time to find some fulfillment outside of your marriage and not in the form of an affair. Having your own hobbies and interests will help you stay independent and keep you happy and engaged with the world. In fact, developing your own interests is a good idea even if you have a great marriage. Consider exploring interests at the library, joining local hobby clubs or cookery classes, or taking a vocational class at a nearby community college.\n5. Try volunteering. Having a sense of purpose and some good social connections with other people is also a good way to feel happy. Volunteering can give you a sense of purpose in life and it also allows you to interact with other like-minded people, it might help you to feel happier. Try to find an organization that you would like to contribute to, such as an animal shelter or a food bank, and apply to become a volunteer. You might even ask your spouse if he or she would like to volunteer with you and it might be a good bonding activity for the two of you.\n6. Develop your social life. Many studies point to relationships being key to happiness. If your main relationship is unhappy, then you may not see how you can change your situation. Your spouse doesn't have to be your main source of social interactions. You can have fulfilling relationships with friends, as well as other members of your family. Try to go out to dinner with friends one night per week or get together with a sibling or cousin for a day of shopping or a activity session such as tennis or swimming. If you don't have a lot of friends, then try to meet more people who share your interests. For example, you could join a bowling league, take an art class, or find a choir or band who need new members.\n\n\n## Work towards a better marriage\n\n1. Take time to be together. Making time for each other is a way to say you are committed to each other. Say you will spend a certain time each week with each other, and stick to it. It will also give you a chance to get to know one another again.\n2. Remember what you valued. When you first got together, you were probably partially attracted by the differences the other person exhibited. For instance, maybe you were exhilarated by the fact that he or she was impulsive and loved to be spontaneous. Now, you may find yourself hating the quality. The key is to try to remember why you loved that quality in the first place and move toward enjoying it again. For instance, it may drive you crazy when your spouse wants to drop everything and drive to the mountains. On the other hand, it keeps your life from getting too boring. Try to strike a balance, and enjoy what you can.\n3. Talk about strengths and difficulties. It is important to acknowledge what is going well in your relationship as well as what has become a struggle. You might even want to make a list of strengths and difficulties together. Make sure that you include things on the list that you avoid talking about because of fears that you will just end up fighting about them. Try to pick a time to talk about your strengths and difficulties when you are both feeling calm and focused. Avoid talking at the end of a long day or at other stressful times. Use \"I\" statements rather than \"You\" statements. In other words, try to talk about what you're feeling and what you think is wrong without blaming the other person. For instance, saying \"I get upset when we don't spend enough time together\" is better than \"You're never around.\" The second statement puts your spouse on guard, while the first helps open discussion. Spend time talking and listening. That is, you can't just lay out what you think is wrong. You also need to spend time actively listening to what your spouse has to say. Show you're engaged by offering short summaries of what he or she has said and by asking questions that are relevant to the conversation.\n4. Work out solutions. Once you've figured out together what issues you have in the marriage, it's time to try to come up with some solutions. You may even be able to draw on some of your strengths to help you develop solutions to problems in your relationships. To compromise, you must talk about your wants and needs, helping you both to decide what's most important to each of you. In other words, to make a compromise, you must be willing to let the other person win when it comes to their needs, giving ground when it comes in conflict with your wants. The same must be true of the other person.\n5. Think about counseling. Sometimes, you need the help of a professional to get past your problems. A marriage counselor may help you fix more problems than you expect, and in fact, about half of people who use marriage counselors say that the counselor helped them fix all of the major problems in their marriage.\n\n\n## Consider the alternative\n\n1. Try legal separation. A legal separation gives you the time away from your spouse that you may need to work out problems. It is different than a divorce because you remain married. The benefit of a separation is it gives you a legal way to work out custody and child support while you are living apart, as well as how your property should be divided up. Nonetheless, if you work out your problems, you can go back to a normal marriage.\n2. Know divorce may be a better option. While getting a divorce is a life upheaval, staying in an unhealthy marriage can be detrimental to self-esteem and mental health. Some studies have shown it's better to get out of a caustic relationship and work to improve your own mental health than to stay. Understand an unhappy marriage can lead to depression. One study, which involved data from 5,000 adults, showed that the quality of your most important relationship is a good predictor of developing depression. Meaning, if one of your closest relationships, including your spousal one, is in bad repair, it puts you at risk for developing depression.\n3. Consider reasons to divorce. You may find that you have a good reason for getting a divorce. If you are unhappy in your marriage, you will likely find that you are a happier person once you get out. You might consider a divorce if your spouse had an affair. While some couples overcome infidelity, others never recover from it. If you find that you can't forgive your spouse for what he or she did even after months or years, you may want to consider a divorce. You've grown in different ways. Sometimes, when you grow into full-fledged adults together, you take different directions. If you find you and your spouse can't agree on much of anything anymore because you are just too different, it may be best to divorce. Your partner is bad at finances and won't change. Of course, everyone makes bad money choices sometimes. However, if your partner is so bad that it is causing stress on your marriage or is bankrupting your family, you may need to get out of the marriage, especially if you've expressed concern but your spouse is unwilling to change. Think about the kids. Many unhappily married couples stay together for the kids. Divorce is hard on kids, but it's also true that being unhappily married can be hard on your kids, as well. Your kids know you're unhappy, and if you're constantly fighting, you're putting stress on them, anyway.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to lighten up your bikini areas?","response":"For all kinds of reasons, some people develop pigmentation in the bikini areas. However, it doesn't have to be a permanent issue. There are a variety of effective, lasting ways to address it. By safely lightening these regions, your skin can have a beautiful, even tone in the bikini areas once again.\n\n## Lighten the bikini areas with home remedy\n\n1. Use Papaya Soap. Papaya soap is natural and using it regularly will help to lighten the skin. Use it at least twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, until you see results. Keep your skin moisturized because it can dry out your skin. You can also mash up a chunk of ripe papaya, and apply a big dollop on the areas. Leave it on for 30 minutes and then wash it off. In a couple of week's time, you should see significant lightening.\n2. Apply glycolic or salicylic acid acne pads. These two ingredients are the lightening agents used for acne treatments and can also be used for this purpose. Dab a pad on the areas and then get into the shower. Let the steam sink in for a couple minutes and wash off. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n3. Use a lemon juice, yogurt mix. Mix juice from 1\/4 lemon into a tablespoon of yogurt, and apply to the area. It acts as a mild bleaching solution that will safely lighten it. Apply aloe vera gel afterwards to keep your skin moist and hydrated. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n4. Apply almond paste. Soak several almonds for 24 hours. Then slide the skins off, and add a couple drops of milk to make a paste. Put on the bikini areas, and leave on for an hour. Wash off with warm water. If used regularly, it works as a mild lightener and also exfoliates and softens the skin.\n5. Try using milk to lighten and moisturize your skin. Pour some milk into a bowl and dip into with a cotton ball. Dab onto your skin. Milk is a natural skin lightener, and it also won't dry it out. It's not going to happen overnight but with regular use, you will see some slight results.\n6. Apply peroxide onto the area. Wipe off after 15 minutes. Do this a couple of times a day until you see results. Peroxide is highly acidic, so you may want to apply a little almond or coconut oil on the area after washing it off. Don't do this treatment immediately after shaving, however, as it could irritate it.\n\n\n## Go to a dermatologist to correct the problem\n\n1. Ask the doctor about using a skin bleaching cream containing hydroquinone. This kind of cream works by preventing melanin from being produced in the skin. It's one of the most popular lightening treatments. However, if the concentration is too high or if it's used for too long, it could worsen the discoloration or reverse the effects. It can also be toxic to the liver.\n2. Talk to your dermatologist about a milder skin bleaching treatment. Some alternative, fading creams that are known to have less side effects are azelaic acid, kojic acid and one containing only 2 percent hydroquinone. All of these are known to help with persistent or residual skin discoloration problems. They work by preventing keratin, a hair protein, from being produced in the skin.\n3. Find out from your doctor if you're a good candidate for using a bleaching agent, such as chlorine, to lighten the areas. This is a mix formulated by the medical professional doing the treatment. Due to the concentration of bleach, dermatologists and medical doctors are the only ones allowed to administer it.\n4. Opt for laser hair removal. If the darkening is caused by waxing, shaving, and\/or you can see dark hair stubble as it's growing back, then laser hair removal may be a good solution for you. Though it's considered semi-permanent, the hair usually doesn't come back. However, you have to make sure to complete the recommended number of treatments and the ongoing, but infrequent, touch-ups.\n\n\n## Prevent darken of the bikini areas\n\n1. Exfoliate the area. Old skin cells don't just build up on your knees and elbows but on other areas of the skin as well. When they accumulate, they can make the skin appear darker and duller. Prior to shaving, lightly exfoliate the region using a loofah, scrub or exfoliating brush. This will remove the dry skin and will also help to prevent skin irritation and ingrown hairs in the bikini areas.\n2. Use sunblock. When going in the sun, use a sunblock to keep the sun from penetrating those areas of your skin that you don't want getting darker. Choose a sunblock with a high SPF number (Sun Protection Factor) such as SPF 45 on that region. Also when you come out of the sun, apply olive oil to the area, as it's also known to be a natural skin lightener.\n3. Wear breathable, cotton clothing that is loose and comfortable. Sweating in the bikini areas are known to cause darkening. Avoid polyester clothing and other synthetic fabrics, as they don't allow the skin to breath. Also tight clothing sometimes causes chafing and could also darken these areas.\n4. Use a quality razor, and shave gently in the direction of the hair growth. If shaving irritates the skin, it could darken it. Basically, dark spots are caused by constant friction. If you shave every day, your skin attempts to protect it so it darkens up. Any type of injury to your skin will either create a stain or keloid. Waxing can also cause darkening if it's too hot.\n5. Eat more vegetables and fruits. Fruits, oranges and berries, in particular, and green, leafy vegetables have lots of antioxidants that assist in reducing discoloration of the skin. Drinking water also helps to flush toxins out of the body.\n6. Drink more water. It is one of the best ways to detoxify. There is no one-size-fits-all to how much water a person should drink. As a general rule, though, women should drink 128 ounces a day, and men should consume 128 ounces of water a day.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to reduce smog?","response":"Smog is a form of air pollution that is produced in the atmosphere when sunlight reacts with nitrogen oxides and at least one volatile organic compound (VOC). When this reaction occurs, particles are released into the atmosphere, and oxygen at the ground level absorbs harmful compounds (ozone). All of this creates what we consider smog. Recent years have seen an increase in campaigns for the reduction of smog due to its harmful effects towards both humans and the environment.\n\n## Change your car habit\n\n1. Drive less. Vehicles that run only on gasoline produce nitrogen dioxide as a byproduct of driving and idling, so one easy way to cut back on emissions is to drive less. Try walking, biking, or taking public transit instead. If your location is close enough, try walking or biking, especially if the destination has showers for clean up (workplace, gym, etc.). Many large cities offer public transportation such as buses, subways, trains and \"park and ride\" which allows you to park your vehicle and take public transit to your destination. Don't drive during certain times. For example, drive less during peak traffic periods, when it is extremely hot, or when there are ozone warnings in effect. This is because gas fumes turn into harmful ground level ozone when they heat up. If driving is a necessity, try setting up a carpool so there are fewer cars on the road and fewer trips being made.\n2. Maintain your car. Keeping your car \"healthy\" will not only improve mileage and save money, it can also reduce emissions. Get regular tune-ups and oil changes and make sure your tires are properly inflated to ensure your car is functioning at its best. Many states require smog and emission tests to make sure your car isn't emitting too much pollution. These are usually required annually or bi-annually. Inflating your tires to the correct pressure allows the engine to function better by maintaining a steady load. Consult your mechanic or your owner's manual for specific information regarding maintenance for your vehicle.\n3. Fuel up in cooler temperatures. Pump gas early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures drop. This prevents the fumes from gasoline from heating up and creating harmful toxins at ground level (ozone). There are alternative fuel sources that are in the works such as ethanol, natural gas, and hydrogen, but not all engines can function off of these fuel sources.\n4. Purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. These vehicles have been known to dramatically reduce emissions for many reasons (depending on the type of model). Some decrease the consumption of fuel while others do away with fuel altogether. The result is a reduction in tailpipe emissions and therefore a reduction in smog. Hybrid vehicles are fueled by gasoline alone but have the ability to recapture energy and use it to power the car, resulting in less fuel consumption. Electric vehicles are powered by electricity alone and must be plugged in and charged in order to drive. Plug-in hybrids are the best of both worlds, running off of either electricity or gasoline.\n\n\n## Change your consumption habit\n\n1. Avoid high VOC products. VOCs are chemicals that easily escape into the atmosphere through common use around the house. Check the front label of household products to determine if they contain VOCs. Examples of common products include nail care products (acetone, ethyl alcohol), paint strippers or adhesive removers (methylene chloride), and aerosol spray products (butane). Check the National Institute of Health's Household Products Database for more information about specific products and their ingredients. Shop for \"green\" products that don't contain VOCs. If you must use VOC products, buy in small quantities that can be used quickly instead of stored. If you must store the product, do so in a tightly sealed, original container, in a well-ventilated area.\n2. Avoid gas-powered yard equipment. Gasoline emissions are one of the major causes of smog--whether from vehicles or lawn equipment. Try eco-friendly lawn mowers, hedgers, trimmers, or any other lawn equipment that can be powered electrically. You can also avoid mowing altogether by changing the material in your yard. Opt for artificial grass, succulents, hard landscapes, or rock gardens to do away with mowing forever. This will also save you time and money spent on maintenance and watering. There are also \"real grass alternatives\" that look and act like traditional grass turf, but require less maintenance.\n3. Buy local. When you buy products that are made locally, it cuts down on the cost of transport which reduces emissions. Local farmers' markets and grocery stores can help you determine where items were produced. There are many sites online that link local buyers and sellers such as Direct Local Food, GrowBuyEat, and AgLocal. Besides farmers' markets, try local farmers' stands, farms, and wineries. There are even many restaurants that are joining the movement towards supporting locally grown items. Make a community garden. Grow vegetables and fruit for your community and local distribution.\n4. Be energy efficient in your home. The less energy you consume at home, the less pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. There are many ways to decrease energy consumption including through lighting, heating and cooling, and appliance use. Replace your old incandescent light bulbs with energy saving halogen incandescents, CFLs, and LEDs which can be found at your local hardware store. For heating and cooling try energy-saving thermostats that automatically reset temperatures while you're away from home. Shop for energy-efficient appliances that use less energy such as washers, dryers, refrigerators, and dishwashers.\n\n\n## Take a stand\n\n1. Don't support organizations that have poor environmental practices. By not supporting commerce from these companies, you raise awareness of the problem. For example, companies like Nestle, Pfizer, and Walmart have been known to not only add pollution to the air but to also violate pollution regulations. An app such as Buycott can help you identify products and companies with poor environmental track records, simply by scanning a product's barcode.\n2. Promote your stance. Don't be afraid to tell people your opinion on the issue, and what you are doing to help solve it. You can do this by speaking to those closest to you (family, friends, co-workers) or reach more people through social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube). Start a community project such as an initiative to replace light bulbs or a carpool to a farmer's market once a month. Start a carpool with your co-workers. Not only will it cut down on emissions but it will demonstrate your passion for the cause.\n3. Contact local politicians and business leaders. Ask them for information about what they are doing to reduce smog levels in your community. If they do not reply or reply with inadequate measures, consider lobbying for change. Sign a petition. There are many petitions online that are lobbying for better air quality control by our government. Find one that peaks your interest, or start your own. Try sites like change.org or petitions.whitehouse.gov to look for petitions or start one on a smaller, local level.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice

Enter any information required by your invoice template to ensure that the final total matches what you're owed. For example, some invoice templates will require you to enter an hourly rate or a fixed charge. Most invoice templates use formulas to combine your entered hourly and the number of hours worked in the \"Final Total\" box.\n7. Save your invoice. Click File in the upper-left side of the page, click Save As, double-click a save location, enter your invoice's name, and click Save. This will save your customized invoice in your selected save location. Your invoice is now ready to be sent.\n\n\n## Use a template on mac\n\n1. Open Microsoft Excel. It's a green box with a white \"X\" on it. Excel will open.\n2. Click File. This menu item is in the top-left side of the page. A drop-down menu will appear below it.\n3. Click New from Template. It's an option in the File drop-down menu. Doing so opens a new page with template options.\n4. Search for an invoice template. Type invoice into the search bar in the top-right corner of the page, then press \u23ce Return. You must be connected to the Internet in order to search for templates.\n5. Select a template. Click a template to open a preview window with the template displayed.\n6. Click Open. It's in the preview window. This will open the invoice template as a new document.\n7. Edit the template to fit your needs. For example, most templates have \"Company\" written across the top; you would replace this heading with your company's name. To edit text on the Excel document, double-click the text item, then remove the text item or replace it with your own.\n8. Fill out the invoice. Enter any information required by your invoice template to ensure that the final total matches what you're owed. For example, some invoice templates will require you to enter an hourly rate or a fixed charge. Most invoice templates use formulas to combine your entered hourly and the number of hours worked in the \"Final Total\" box.\n9. Save your invoice. Click the File menu item, click Save As, enter a name for your invoice, and click Save. Your invoice is now ready to be sent.\n\n\n## Create an invoice manually\n\n1. Open Microsoft Excel. It's a green box with a white \"X\" on it. The Microsoft Excel home page will open.\n2. Click Blank Workbook. This option is in the upper-left side of the Excel home page. A blank spreadsheet will open. On Mac, skip this step if Excel opens to a blank document.\n3. Create the invoice heading. Your heading should include the following information:\n\t* \n\t* Company name - The name of the company to whom the invoice funds will be allocated. Descriptor - The word \"Invoice\" or a description of the type of invoice it is, such as \"Price Quote\" if you're quoting a price for your services to a client instead of billing for them. Date - The date on which you're writing the invoice. Number - The invoice number. You can either use a global numbering system for all your clients or individual numbering for each client. If you choose to number for each client, you can include the client name or a form of it in the invoice number, such as \"Westwood1.\"\n4. Enter the sender and recipient addresses. This information should appear near the top of the invoice, with your information above the client's. Your contact information should include your name, your company's address, a phone number, and an email address. Your client's information should include the company name, the name of the accounts payable person, and the client address. You can also include the client's phone and email address.\n5. Enter your billing information. You can devote a column to a short description of the product or service, a column to quantity, a column to unit price or rate, and a calculated column for the total price for the quantity purchased of that item.\n6. Display the amount of the total bill. This should appear below the calculated column of individual charges and can be generated with Excel's SUM function. For example: if you have $13 of work in cell B3 and $27 of work in B4, you might put the formula =SUM(B3,B4) in cell B5 to display $40 in that cell. If you used an hourly rate (e.g., $30) in cell B3 and a number of hours (e.g., 3) in B4, you would instead write =SUM(B3\\*B4) in cell B5.\n7. Include the terms of payment. This can appear either above or below the billing information. Common payment terms are \"Due on receipt,\" \"Due within 14 days,\" \"Due within 30 days,\" or \"Due within 60 days.\" You may also want to include a memo at the bottom of the invoice covering accepted methods of payment, general information, or a thank-you to your customer for shopping with you.\n8. Save your invoice. Use a name that will distinguish the invoice from other invoices you've sent to your client if necessary. To save your invoice:\n\t* \n\t* Windows - Click File in the upper-left side of the page, click Save As, double-click a save location, enter your invoice's name, and click Save. Mac - Click the File menu item, click Save As, enter a name for your invoice, and click Save.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The icon is

{"instruction":"How to diagnose adrenal gland disease in pomeranians?","response":"Pomeranians are a breed that are especially prone to baldness problems. While your dog may have other adrenal gland diseases, such as Cushing's Disease or Addison's Disease, Alopecia X is the most common condition that affects Pomeranians. Adrenal gland disease goes by a variety of names, such as Alopecia X, Black Skin Disease, and Growth Hormone Responsive Dermatosis, among others. Adrenal gland disease is a puzzling condition, and vets are not really sure of the cause. There are ways to diagnose if your dog has this condition.\n\n## Identify symptoms\n\n1. Watch for odd patches of fur. One of the first signs of adrenal gland disease is patches of hair that look different than the rest of the coat. These patches will contain hair that is short and oddly textured, like wool.\n2. Look for symmetrical hair loss. When a dog has adrenal gland disease, the Pomeranian sheds her fur right down to the skin and the fur doesn't regrow. The fur loss is in a symmetrical pattern so the hair loss on the left of the body mirrors that on the right. Hair loss usually occurs on the trunk and back thighs, and not on the head or front legs.\n3. Watch for dark patches of skin. When the dog loses her hair, the exposed skin often becomes hyperpigmented. This means that the skin changes from a regular pink or beige color into a dark brown or black color. Additionally, the skin is often dry and scaly.\n4. Be alert for any lack of hair growth. Another way you know your Pomeranian has this condition is that hair does not regrow after it has been clipped or shaved.\n5. Know that this condition can affect any dog. Pomeranians of any age or sex can be affected. This means that through your dog\u2019s entire life, you need to watch for signs of this condition. Although a dog can get this condition any time, the dog is healthy otherwise even if she does start to show the symptoms.\n\n\n## Diagnose the disease\n\n1. Be aware of an unspecific diagnosis. The problem with diagnosing adrenal gland disease is that vets aren't sure why it occurs in the first place. This makes it impossible to develop a single test that gives a definitive answer as whether baldness is specifically due adrenal gland disease or some other problem.\n2. Take your dog to the vet. The vet has to rule out all other problems which could cause hair loss. This means conducting an extensive array of tests searching for specific conditions, which can then be confirmed or crossed off the list. Once all these tests are done, and if they all come back negative, then the condition is likely to be adrenal gland disease. Adrenal gland disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means all other possible causes of hair loss have to be crossed off the list in order to diagnose the condition. Many of the symptoms of adrenal gland disease, like hair loss, can be due to more serious diseases, such as Cushing's Disease. Alopecia X is not life threatening, but other adrenal gland diseases can be serious if left untreated. This is why taking your dog to the vet is so important.\n3. Have multiple tests run. The vet may want to run some or all of the following tests, which will prove or rule out other conditions which may be similar to adrenal gland disease. The tests include:\n\t* Thyroid blood test\n\t* Adrenal hormone test\n\t* A urinalysis\n\t* Abdominal ultrasound\n\t* Skin scrapes\n\t* Skin biopsy\n\t* Screening blood tests\n4. Notice the effects of this disease. When your dog gets this condition, know that it is a cosmetic condition. Your dog will not be in any pain. If your vet has ruled out any other underlying condition, then your dog can live a happy life with the condition.\n5. Find the proper treatment. Most treatments for Alopecia X focus on helping the dog grow the coat back, but they are trial and error. Many adrenal gland problems are caused by hormonal imbalances, so dogs may be spayed or neutered. If this is not an option, melatonin therapy may be suggested. Other treatment options may be available if these don't work. However, they can cause adverse reactions, so the adverse health effects need to be considered next to the cosmetic benefits.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to keep a dog hydrated?","response":"Water is essential for your dog\u2019s digestion, circulation, waste filtering, and body temperature. Your dog should drink about one ounce of water for every pound of weight on a daily basis, though they may need more if they are exercising or if it\u2019s hot outside. To ensure your dog stays hydrated, invest in a quality water bowl and make sure you are hydrating your dog effectively at home and on the go. If you think your pup is experiencing dehydration, bring them to the vet right away. Dehydration can be life threatening if it goes untreated.\n\n## Use a quality water bowl\n\n1. Get a water bowl that is the right size for your dog. Make sure your dog\u2019s water bowl is the right size for them, as a bowl that is too big or too small will limit their access to water. Check that the water bowl is made for a small, medium, or large dog. Get the size that will make it easy for your pup to bend down and drink from the bowl. For example, tall, narrow bowls are ideal for dogs with long ears, such as Bassets and Spaniels. This can help to keep their ears out of the bowl, which can reduce the risk of ear infections. Smaller dogs do well with a water bowl that is low and shallow, as this will make it easier for them to drink from the bowl. A bowl that is big and wide is ideal for medium to large dogs.\n2. Buy a weighted water bowl. A weighted water bowl will have a heavier bottom, making them less likely to tip over. This may be a good investment if you are worried about your dog tipping over their water bowl or moving the bowl around and spilling the water while they drink. Look for weighted water bowls online or at your local pet store. Test the water bowl before you give it to your dog to use. Fill it with water and tap or try to tip one side of the bowl. A weighted water bowl should make it harder to do this.\n3. Invest in a water fountain. Larger dogs and dogs who are picky about their water may benefit from a water fountain. Most water fountains will filter and recirculate the water so it is fresh and tastes delicious to your dog. You can buy water fountains online or at your local pet store.\n\n\n## Hydrate your dog at home\n\n1. Fill your dog\u2019s water bowl daily. Make sure you keep your dog\u2019s water bowl filled with fresh water on a daily basis. Fill it up first thing in the morning when you give your dog their breakfast. Then, check their water bowl throughout the day to make sure it is full. Fill it up again at dinner time, if it needs refilling. Make sure you toss out any old water from the previous day before you fill it up with fresh water. This will ensure the water tastes good to your dog and is free of bacteria.\n2. Clean their water bowl regularly. Bacteria can end up sitting on the rim of the water bowl and in any water still in the water bowl. Get in the habit of cleaning your dog\u2019s water bowl on a daily basis. Use soap and water to remove any grime or dirt in the bowl or on the rim. Dry the bowl well before you fill it up with fresh water and set it down for your pup. For example, you may clean the bowl first thing in the morning before filling it up with fresh water. This way, it will stay clean for the rest of the day until you clean it again the following morning.\n3. Place water bowls for your dog throughout your home. If your dog likes to roam through your home, make sure you have water sources located throughout the space for them. Put water bowls on each floor of your home. Set up water fountains in several spots in your house so your dog always has access to fresh water. Doing this will ensure your dog never gets dehydrated. Make sure you clean all of your dog\u2019s water sources in your home on a daily basis. This will ensure they do not get dirty or contract any bacteria.\n4. Keep the toilet seat down in your home. Prevent your dog from drinking from the toilet bowl by keeping the seat down at all times. The water in your toilet bowl likely contains bacteria and other pathogens that are harmful to dogs. Keeping the seat down will make it difficult for your dog to access the toilet bowl water. It will also encourage them to drink the fresh, clean water from their water bowl instead. If your dog really enjoys drinking from the toilet, consider purchasing a ceramic bowl for them that will mimic the type of \u201cbowl\u201d your toilet is.\n5. Switch your dog to wet food. To encourage your dog to stay hydrated, consider switching from dry dog food to wet dog food. Wet dog food contains more water and can help your dog stay hydrated. Add water to their wet food at a 1:1 ratio to help your dog drink more water. You can also try giving your dog two wet food meals and one dry food meal a day. Wet dog food can be more expensive than dry food and requires more preparation time, so this may be a good option if you\u2019re short on time and money. If your dog will eat all of their dry food at one time, you can try adding water to the dry food. Many dogs will consume all of the dog food as well as the water.\n\n\n## Hydrate your dog on the go\n\n1. Bring bottled water on walks or long trips. Dogs can often get dehydrated when they are out for a long walk or running around outside during a play session. Long car trips can also make your dog thirsty, especially if it is a hot day. Pack bottled water or water jugs and your dog\u2019s water bowl so you can provide fresh water for them on the go. Some dogs can be trained to drink from a squirt bottle. Try to get your dog used to drinking from a squirt bottle so you can bring it with you when you go on a walk or to a dog park. This will make it easier for you to squirt water into your dog\u2019s mouth if they start to get dehydrated. You can also purchase a portable, collapsible dog bowl to take with you on the go.\n2. Give your dog ice cubes as treats. Ice cubes are often a fun treat for dogs and can help them stay hydrated. Use ice cubes as a reward when your dog does a trick or follows an obedience command. Pack a cooler of ice cubes on a long trips and give them to your dog periodically to ensure they stay hydrated. To make the ice cubes more appetizing, you can try putting a dog treat in water in the ice cube tray and freeze it overnight. This way, your dog can lick the water, working their way to the treat inside the ice cube.\n3. Do not keep your dog tied up outside. Try not to keep your dog chained or tied up outside, especially on hot days. Dogs can end up wrapping their chain or leash around poles or trees, make it impossible for them to access their water bowls. Do not leave your dog tied up unattended for prolonged periods of time. If you do need to keep your dog contained, put them in their crate or kennel with access to a water bottle or a water bowl. This way, they will still be able to access fresh water.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to love someone the way he is?","response":"Being around someone often can make their faults seem more significant. However, people have defined personalities that are not likely to change, even if something annoys you. When loving a spouse, partner, or family member, it is important that you love him the way he is and do not expect him to change. This can sometimes be difficult. It requires finding the best in the person you love, accepting his flaws, and coping with your own insecurities.\n\n## Find the best in him\n\n1. Make a pros and cons list. Taking time to think about all of a person's positive qualities can help you to remember what you love about them. At the same time, noting what frustrates you about a person can help to put things into perspective. Make a list of all of the things you love about this person and all of the things that annoy you about him. Review the list and pay special attention to the pros, such as his kind nature, his sense of humor, or the interests you share with him. Remind yourself that the things that annoy you may be things that can change in time, such as being a smoker, having a hard time remembering important dates, or seeming unmotivated.\n2. Look for reasons to compliment him. People are extremely complicated beings that can be seen from many different angles. Whatever you choose to look for in a person, you are likely to find. Avoid looking for negative traits, and instead look for good traits within him. Reinforce those traits in his behavior (and in your own mind) by complimenting him often. For example, you could compliment his intelligence.\n3. Focus on positive feelings. Again, where you put your own focus is crucial to determining how you feel about someone. In any person, there are things that will make you feel good and things that will make you feel bad. If you want to love him, pay attention to the things that make you feel good when you are with him. For example, you should focus on how he notices your feelings instead of how he doesn't keep his bedroom clean.\n4. Make happy memories. Any kind of loving relationship needs reinforcement. You can strengthen your love for him by creating happy memories. Do things that both of you enjoy doing and spend time reflecting on it. If you have a lot of separate interests, take turns doing something the other would like. For example, if you both enjoy movies, you could take turns choosing a movie at the theater or for a home movie night.\n\n\n## Accept his imperfections\n\n1. Avoid nagging him. The opposite of complimenting a person is nagging them. When you find small details about a person and use them to vent your own frustrations or insecurities, it undermines the relationship. If you need to talk to him about something he is (or isn't) doing, you should have a clear, calm conversation about it. Tell him what you expect him to do, and let him do it. For example, instead of nagging him for not doing the dishes, you could just say something like \u201cI could really use some help with the dishes when you have time.\u201d\n2. Withhold judgement for his actions. Even if you love someone, you should realize that you will not always agree with everything they do. If something he does bothers you, you can talk to him about it, but avoid turning it into a general label on his personality. By withholding judgment, you see him as a whole person and not just the sum of his mistakes. For example, if he forgets to do the dishes (even though you reminded him), keep in mind that he has a lot going on, too. While it is fair to expect help, you should not judge him as lazy or inconsiderate when he doesn't get everything done.\n3. Remind yourself that you love him. Telling him you love him is important. Telling yourself that you love him is just as important. It is easy to get frustrated with someone and analyze all of their faults. Instead, you should remind yourself constantly that you love him and that your frustration with him doesn't define him. For example, if he forgot your birthday, you are probably going to be pretty frustrated. Instead of focusing on how badly that hurt, remind yourself that you love him the way he is and that you can still celebrate your birthday with him even if you had to remind him.\n4. Avoid unrealistic expectations. The man you love is not perfect. That is because nobody is perfect. Though it might be easy for you to imagine a fairytale romance, be aware that such relationships rarely (if ever) happen in real life. In fact, a happy relationship takes work from both sides and requires realistic expectations. The idea of a \u201cMr. Right\u201d just waiting around the corner for you will likely destroy your relationship over time.\n5. Be willing to compromise. Relationships are all about compromise and flexibility. Though you shouldn't settle for being with someone that you don't love, you should realize that you will have to give up some of the things on your checklist if you want to love someone. The man you love isn't likely to be able to satisfy your every fantasy or whim, but he can love you and satisfy some of those things. The rest, you will have to accept as qualities that he does not possess. For example, the man you love might not be able to dance and sing you love songs with perfect pitch. In this case, you might have to settle for him willing dance with you and belt out some karaoke (even if it's bad karaoke).\n\n\n## Cop with your insecurities\n\n1. Come to terms with jealousy. There are two types of jealousy that can affect your love for him. You can be jealous of his life, or you can be jealous of his attention. Either one will lead to disagreements and hard feelings. If you are feeling jealous, analyze why and move on. An example of being jealous of his life is wishing that you had as many friends as he does. An example of being jealous of his attention is wishing that he would stop hanging out with his friends and spend his time with you.\n2. Reflect on insecure feelings. Jealousy is not the only feeling that can get in the way of loving him. You might also feel things like sadness, resentment, or neglect. If you have any negative or insecure feelings, you should not repress them or act on them. Instead, analyze what makes you feel that way. Once you know what is bothering you, you can work on accepting that part of his personality. For example, if it bothers you that is never on time, once you realize this you can start accepting it as a part of his personality rather than viewing it as a lack of caring for you. Avoid taking things too personally. Keep in mind that some of his actions may be harmless and not reflect any deeper meanings other than what you assign to them.\n3. Work on correcting your insecurities. This might take a lot of time and practice. Be patient with yourself, and constantly analyze why you feel insecure. It might help to keep a diary of your feelings so that you can monitor them. If you are having a lot of difficulty with your feelings, you can consult a mental health professional. Do not leave the diary somewhere that he can read it. Explain that it is private if he seems uncertain. You may prefer to keep a diary in a file on your computer. Another way to work through your insecurities is to be open and honest about them. Do not blame them on the man you love, but use \u201cI\u201d statements like \u201cI sometimes feel that our relationship might fade over time.\u201d\n\t* You might even consider sharing some of your insecurities with him if you are comfortable doing so. This can help to strengthen your relationship. Hiding things may only lead to trouble in the future.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to cascade routers?","response":"A good way to expand your wired or wireless network is to cascade routers. A router cascade means that 2 or more routers are connected to each other through an Ethernet cable. There are 2 ways to cascade routers: connect an Ethernet port on the second router to an Ethernet port on the first, or connect the Internet port on the second router to an Ethernet port on the first.\n\n## Connect ethernet to ethernet (lan to lan)\n\n1. Designate which routers will be the primary and which will be secondary. Your primary modem is the router with a direct connection to the internet or modem. Your secondary router will be connected to the internet through the primary router. Generally, you should use the most current router as your primary router.\n2. Plug your secondary router in. Connect an AC adapter to your secondary router, and plug it into an electrical outlet near a computer you can use to set up the secondary router.\n3. Connect your computer directly to your secondary router. Use an Ethernet cable to plug into one of the numbered Ethernet ports on the back of the router and to an Ethernet port on your computer. Make sure it is not plugged into your primary router.\n4. Access your router's web-based configuration menu. Connect to the secondary router's IP address with a web browser. Depending on the make of your router, you may have to navigate to a specific URL to access your router's web-based configuration menu. Consult your router's user manual or manufacturer's website to find out what the IP address for your router is. 192.168.1.1 is one of the most common router IP addresses. You may need to log in to the router's configuration menu. \"Admin\" is the most common username and\/or password. Consult the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn more about how to log in to your router's configuration page.\n5. Change the secondary router's IP address. Look for this option under local IP settings. The key here is to make sure that your secondary router has a different final digit than the IP address of your primary router. An example IP for your primary router is 192.168.1.1. So an example of your secondary router's IP address could be 192.168.1.2.\n6. Turn off the secondary router's DHCP Server settings. The configuration menu is different for each router make and model. This can often be found under \"Setup\", \"Advanced Settings\", \"Network Settings\", ect. Read \"How to Configure a Router to Use DHCP\" to learn more about how to locate the router's DHCP settings.\n7. Make sure your secondary router is set to router operating mode. This is often located in an advanced settings menu.\n8. Connect the secondary router to the primary router. Use an Ethernet cable to plug into any one of the numbered Ethernet ports on the primary router. Then Plug the other end of that cable into a numbered Ethernet port on the back of the secondary router. Your routers are now cascaded.\n\n\n## Connect ethernet to internet (lan to wan)\n\n1. Plug in your secondary router. Use the AC adapter that came with your router to plug it into an electrical outlet near a computer you can use to setup your secondary router.\n2. Connect your computer to your secondary router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to one of the numbered ports on your secondary router. Connect the other end to an Ethernet port on your computer.\n3. Access the web-based configuration menu. Enter the secondary router's IP address into a web browser to access the router's IP address. 192.168.1.1 is one of the most common router IP addresses. If that does not work, consult the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn how to log in to the routers configuration page. You may need to log in to the router's configuration menu. \"Admin\" is the most common username and\/or password. Consult the user's manual or manufacturer's website to learn more about how to log in to your router's configuration page.\n4. Change the local IP address. The second-to-last digit of your local IP address should be different from your primary router. If your primary IP address is 192.168.0.1 then your secondary router's IP address should be something like 192.168.2.1.\n5. Save your IP address changes. Disconnect your secondary router from your computer.\n6. Connect your primary router to you secondary router. Use an Ethernet cable to connect to one of the numbered ports on your primary router. Then plug the other end of the cable into the Internet port of your secondary router. Your routers are now cascaded.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"A network can be wired.","max_prob":4.800219059,"ccp":-0.3048850817},{"claim":"A

{"instruction":"How to look up a bible verse?","response":"People quote the Bible in a variety of contexts. If you want to be able to look those quotes up, you\u2019ll need to understand the way the Bible is organized. It\u2019s also possible to look up quotes without knowing their location. Simply knowing a couple of words from a verse can be enough to help you locate it if you know how.\n\n## Look up a verse by number\n\n1. Identify the book of the verse. When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you\u2019ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:\n\t* Exodus (Ex)\n\t* Genesis (Gen)\n\t* Numbers (Num)\n2. Identify the chapter. After the book name, you\u2019ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in \u201cJohn 3:16\u201d, \u201c3\u201d is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter it is from in the book. Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13. Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter. As with other books, it should clearly say, \u201cChapter \\_\\_\u201d at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, many versions clearly say,  : at the top of each page indicating the first verse on that page. Some also note the last verse on the page.\n3. Identify the verse number. The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number. If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.\n4. Locate the verse within the chapter. Once you\u2019ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16.\n\n\n## Look up a verse with a concordance\n\n1. Choose a concordance. A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word\u2019s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don\u2019t know which book or chapter it came from. Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.\n2. Search for a word from the verse. Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized. Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as \u201cflood,\u201d \u201cmountain,\u201d or \u201crubies.\u201d If you choose something like \u201clove\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d you\u2019re likely to find an enormous number of results.\n3. Search for other words if necessary. If you find too many results, or you don\u2019t see the verse you\u2019re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, \u201clove must be sincere\u201d and you searched \u201clove\u201d but found too many results, try looking up, \u201csincere.\u201d\n4. Locate the verse from the concordance list. The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it\u2019s the verse you\u2019re looking for. Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.\n5. Try another translation if necessary. Concordances are specific to translations. If you can\u2019t find the verse you\u2019re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word \u201cpraise,\" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as \u201cworship,\u201d it will be impossible to look up the verse.\n\n\n## Look up a verse online\n\n1. Search the verse number online. Choose a search engine, or go to a website dedicated to Bible study. Type the name of the book and the chapter and verse numbers into the search engine. Type the verse number in the generally accepted format if you can. For example, you'll get more accurate results if you type, \"John 3:16,\" than, \"Chapter 3 16 John.\"\n2. Remember what you can about the verse. Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can\u2019t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse.\n3. Enter what you know into a search engine. Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words \u201cBible\u201d and \u201cverse\u201d to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search. Your search terms may be something like, \u201cBible verse about wives in Psalms,\u201d or \u201cBible verse chapter 7 desert.\u201d\n4. Use a site designed for Bible searches. There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter. These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.\n5. Search related words. If you can\u2019t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for \u201cstars\u201d and didn\u2019t find anything, you could search for \u201cnight\u201d or \u201csky\u201d or \u201cheavens\u201d to see if the verse shows up. It\u2019s possible you\u2019re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Knowing a couple of words from a verse can be enough to help you locate it.","max_prob":25.8513679504,"ccp":-0.01790061},{"claim":"You can locate a verse if you know how.","max_prob":32.4360160828,"ccp":-0.01790061},{"claim":"Bible verses can be listed.","max_prob":10.290520668,"ccp":-0.0081677513},{"claim":"The first thing you see when Bible verses are listed is the name of a book.","max_prob":21.6779556274,"ccp":-0.0079868049},{"claim":"There is a table of contents in the Bible.","max_prob":2.1856782436,"ccp":-0.2940243742},{"claim":"The table of contents is located at the beginning of the Bible.","max_prob":9.6294717789,"ccp":-0.2905411144},{"claim":"\"John 3:16\" is a reference from a text.","max_prob":10.4928741455,"ccp":-0.0497638996},{"claim":"\"3\" is the chapter number in the reference \"John 3:16\".","max_prob":2.4786794186,"ccp":-0.1344552699},{"claim":"There may be two numbers.","max_prob":9.0231647491,"ccp":-0.54933039},{"claim":"The two numbers may be separated by a hyphen (-).","max_prob":13.0987129211,"ccp":-0.333078737},{"claim":"The situation described occurs when looking up a longer passage.","max_prob":9.8445272446,"ccp":-0.1887729981},{"claim":"The verses go in numerical order.","max_prob":12.064245224,"ccp":-0.6375088914},{"claim":"A concordance is a book.","max_prob":1.6018941402,"ccp":-0.7359838366},{"claim":"A concordance lists every instance of a word\u2019s appearance in the Bible.","max_prob":15.5642766953,"ccp":-0.3041846945},{"claim":"Concordances can be found through religious retailers.","max_prob":19.110458374,"ccp":-0.2825625998},{"claim":"Concordances can be found online.","max_prob":5.0313472748,"ccp":-0.7223558891},{"claim":"Concordances exist.","max_prob":0.0353761315,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"Concordances are organized in alphabetical order.","max_prob":5.2887277603,"ccp":-0.9672081452},{"claim":"Concordances are specific.","max_prob":5.4793949127,"ccp":-0.4110638564},{"claim":"Concordances are specific to translations.","max_prob":7.9310464859,"ccp":-0.4020316339},{"claim":"There are sites online that catalog Bible verses.","max_prob":12.7815189362,"ccp":-0.9154391547},{"claim":"These sites catalog Bible verses by subject.","max_prob":15.4735021591,"ccp":-0.4713602021},{"claim":"These sites catalog Bible verses by book.","max_prob":14.5144939423,"ccp":-0.2934966218},{"claim":"There are online tools.","max_prob":7.8538312912,"ccp":-0.9129500263},{"claim":"Online tools can be great ways to find other verses.","max_prob":22.9507808685,"ccp":-0.9129500263},{"claim":"The verses found may be relevant to you.","max_prob":8.1227025986,"ccp":-0.9622579484},{"claim":"The verses found may be helpful in your studies.","max_prob":11.8679580688,"ccp":-0.9622579484},{"claim":"The verses found may be helpful in your prayers.","max_prob":14.2023963928,"ccp":-0.4945705946}]}
{"instruction":"How to fold polo shirts?","response":"Polo shirts are great because you can wear them almost anywhere. To keep your polo shirts looking good, make sure to fold them correctly. Start by placing them on a firm, flat surface. Fold in the sides and sleeves before bringing the bottom seam right below the collar. Store your polos by rolling them into tight bundles or stacking them on top of one another in a moth-free setting.\n\n## Fold your polo in the traditional way\n\n1. Lay the shirt on a flat surface. Find a flat, smooth surface, like a laundry table. Position the shirt on the middle of the surface with the button-side (front) facing down. Stretch out the sleeves to each side. Make sure that the edges of the shirt do not fall off the sides of the surface. Fully button up the shirt from top to bottom. Button up the cuffs as well.\n2. Fold the sleeves back. Grab each sleeve and fold it to the middle of the back of the shirt (the button-free side that is currently facing upwards). Try to keep the each sleeve horizontal. This will make the cuffs overlap in the middle center of the shirt. As you adjust the sleeves, be careful not to pull the side seams of the shirt towards the back. You are just folding the sleeves in at this point, not the core of the shirt. If you have a short-sleeved polo, you will still fold the sleeves toward the middle of the back of the shirt. However, the sleeves will not overlap in the middle.\n3. Smooth the shirt out with your hands. The key to folding any shirt, including polo style, is to run your hands over the fabric after every fold. This helps to smooth out the wrinkles and to ensure tight, secure folds. If you come upon a heavy wrinkle in the fabric, make minor adjustments until it disappears.\n4. Fold in the sides of the shirt. With the front of the shirt still facing down, gently grasp one side of the shirt with both hands. Fold this side inwards until it touches the middle of the shirt\u2019s back. Do the same thing with the other side. If you do this correctly, you should see a \u201cV\u201d at the top back of the shirt right below the collar. If you have a short-sleeved polo, this fold will help to keep your sleeves in place moving forward. Make sure to hold your sleeves in place as you complete this step or they may move around as you lift the sides to fold inwards.\n5. Fold the shirt in half. Keep the button-side of the shirt facing down. Grasp the bottom edge of the polo shirt. Fold the edge upwards until the shirt is essentially at half of the full length. When you are finished you want the bottom edge of the shirt to rest right at the lower edge of the collar.\n6. Do an extra fold depending on the shirt\u2019s length. If your shirt is extra large or extra long, then a single bottom fold may not be enough. You may need to divide the length of the shirt into thirds or fourths, adding in 1 or 2 additional folds.\n7. Flip and store. Grab your folded shirt and flip it over. The collar should now face upwards. This is a great way to store your polo shirts, as it keeps the collars and sleeves crisp. It\u2019s even safe to stack multiple shirts on top of one another for storage, as the pressure will keep any wrinkles at bay.\n\n\n## Roll your polo shirt\n\n1. Save space by rolling. If you have a small closet or just a single drawer to use, then rolling is good option. Many people also prefer to roll all of their clothes when packing suitcases, as it makes it easy to select outfits quickly. The downside of rolling is that it can leave polo shirts a bit wrinkled. Address this problem by giving yourself some time to steam a shirt after unrolling it.\n2. Fold the shirt in from the bottom. Lay your polo shirt on a flat surface with the buttons facing up. Grasp the bottom edge of the shirt and fold it upwards about 4 inches (10 cm). This will shorten the total length of the shirt and help you to create a tighter roll.\n3. Fold in the sides. Grab one side of your polo shirt, place the sleeve facing outward, and fold the fabric inward toward the center. Do the same thing with the other side of the shirt. This means that the outer edges of your shirt will now meet in the center with overlapping sleeves.\n4. Start rolling from the collar. Grab the collar in both of your hands and begin rolling downwards. Try to keep your hands firm on the fabric, so that the final roll is tight and secure. When you reach the bottom of the shirt, press lightly against the sides of the roll. The final roll should be around 6 inches (15 cm) in width.\n\n\n## Clean your polo shirt before store\n\n1. Wash the shirt according to the instructions. Locate the tag on your polo. It will probably be at the collar or on the inner side-seam. Read how to wash your polo and follow these directions exactly. For 100% cotton polos, this will usually mean washing them on a warm water setting. For mixed fabric blends, it is usually safer to go with a cold water setting. It\u2019s also okay to hand wash most polos, as long as you stick with the same suggested water temperature.\n2. Dry the shirt. You really want to avoid shrinking your polos, so make sure that you follow the drying instructions as well. If you machine dry your polos, use the lowest heat setting. It\u2019s better, though, to hang your polo shirts up on a drying rack until they are fully dry. This will keep your shirts looking the best for the longest period of time. Be aware that drying your polos on a rack might make them look more wrinkly. However, this can be quickly fixed with a round of steaming or ironing.\n3. Remove any wrinkles with steaming or ironing. Get out your ironing board and set your iron to a medium or low heat setting. Go over your polo with the iron, keeping it moving to prevent burning the fabric. Look at the tag for any additional instructions. Some polos need to be turned inside out before ironing. You can also hang up your polo and use a steam machine to work out any wrinkles. Pass the steamer wand close to, but not touching, the fabric until it smooths out. Polo shirts have a tendency to get particularly wrinkly around the collar, so pay additional attention to this area. Also, make sure to reinsert any collar stays after you are finished steaming or ironing your shirt.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You can store polos by rolling them into tight bundles.","max_prob":18.3558807373,"ccp":-0.0520174186},{"claim":"You can store polos by stacking them on top of one another.","max_prob":9.8374786377,"ccp":-0.4690360013},{"claim":"The setting for storing polos should be moth-free.","max_prob":27.2892532349,"ccp":-0.0000014968},{"claim":"The shirt is positioned on the surface.","max_prob":3.1122438908,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"The shirt is positioned in the middle of the surface.","max_prob":9.4923219681,"ccp":-0.0137267669},{"claim":"The button-side of the shirt is facing down.","max_prob":12.504193306,"ccp":-0.1504911219},{"claim":"The key to folding any shirt is to run your hands over the fabric after every fold.","max_prob":29.4888877869,"ccp":-0.0016692939},{"claim":"Polo style shirts are included in the category of \"any shirt.\"","max_prob":13.8647270203,"ccp":-0.2962402988},{"claim":"You have a short-sleeved polo.","max_prob":2.4837348461,"ccp":-0.6196203274},{"claim":"This fold will help to keep your sleeves in place.","max_prob":22.1782836914,"ccp":-0.2326241577},{"claim":"This is a way to store your polo shirts.","max_prob":6.5161504745,"ccp":-0.8309292452},{"claim":"It is safe to stack multiple shirts on top of one another for storage.","max_prob":18.2697849274,"ccp":-0.7055728163},{"claim":"The pressure from stacking shirts will keep any wrinkles at bay.","max_prob":21.2792205811,"ccp":-0.0580581603},{"claim":"Many people prefer to roll all of their clothes when packing suitcases.","max_prob":18.6934337616,"ccp":-0.2103764248},{"claim":"Rolling clothes when packing suitcases makes it easy to select outfits quickly.","max_prob":30.900478363,"ccp":-0.8346106555},{"claim":"Rolling can leave polo shirts wrinkled.","max_prob":11.4602594376,"ccp":-0.4339788571},{"claim":"Rolling has a downside.","max_prob":4.6516833305,"ccp":-0.083077749},{"claim":"This action will shorten the total length of the shirt.","max_prob":11.3281641006,"ccp":-0.24037007},{"claim":"This action will help you to create a tighter roll.","max_prob":11.057767868,"ccp":-0.234966834},{"claim":"Grab one side of your polo shirt.","max_prob":5.8141288757,"ccp":-0.727652185},{"claim":"Place the sleeve facing outward.","max_prob":24.8586273193,"ccp":-0.0000825985},{"claim":"Fold the fabric inward toward the center.","max_prob":11.3375911713,"ccp":-0.8489415109},{"claim":"The final roll should be around 6 inches in width.","max_prob":16.4732055664,"ccp":-0.0080644075},{"claim":"The final roll should be around 15 cm in width.","max_prob":13.3089666367,"ccp":-0.1325893295},{"claim":"100% cotton polos exist.","max_prob":1.833298564,"ccp":-0.5254890743},{"claim":"100% cotton polos can be washed.","max_prob":2.9957528114,"ccp":-0.4168415291},{"claim":"Washing 100% cotton polos usually involves using a warm water setting.","max_prob":14.2853527069,"ccp":-0.0161981352},{"claim":"It is okay to hand wash most polos.","max_prob":14.124786377,"ccp":-0.1487271155},{"claim":"You should stick with the suggested water temperature when hand washing most polos.","max_prob":21.9536094666,"ccp":-0.4805220989},{"claim":"You have an ironing board.","max_prob":3.3363165855,"ccp":-0.3872567154},{"claim":"You have an iron.","max_prob":0.9909870625,"ccp":-0.8430682871},{"claim":"The iron has a heat setting.","max_prob":8.5121870041,"ccp":-0.2739606408},{"claim":"The heat setting can be adjusted to medium.","max_prob":9.5134496689,"ccp":-0.1964341826},{"claim":"The heat setting can be adjusted to low.","max_prob":9.4768724442,"ccp":-0.1538832545},{"claim":"You can hang up your polo.","max_prob":7.9055171013,"ccp":-0.0289628203},{"claim":"You can use a steam machine.","max_prob":8.4287614822,"ccp":-0.4713895516},{"claim":"A steam machine can work out wrinkles.","max_prob":12.2081098557,"ccp":-0.5150396623},{"claim":"Polo shirts have a tendency to get wrinkly around the collar.","max_prob":12.7304878235,"ccp":-0.8020758854},{"claim":"Additional attention should be paid to the collar area of polo shirts.","max_prob":9.9137039185,"ccp":-0.4191511791}]}

Answer the important questions (in your mind of course) like He is saying and insisting that God will protect me from this mean dishwasher I have at my dishwashing job . But wait even the devils believe in God and tremble James 2: 19,this guy is not telling me stuff like report the mean dishwasher to the police, instead this ^healer^ is telling me to just trust in God.So I better not follow what this ^healer^ says. for example.\n3. Act on the answers to your important questions like going to the police to report a mean dishwasher assaulting you at your dishwashing job for example and tell yourself either in your mind or verbally or both like ^good and holy advice^ that I should just trust in God, because even the demons believe in God and tremble James 2: 19, so I must never just trust God, I must do actions as well to get what I need done get done. for example.\n4. Take heed of websites, others etc. warning about fake faith healers.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to save gift wrapping paper?","response":"We've all seen promotional material for having \"green\" (environmentally sound) events, conserving paper, and saving trees.  In this article we'll see several alternatives to one time usage of rolls of wrapping paper for gifts.\n\n## Reuse wrap paper\n\n1. Wrap the gift in such a way as to promote reuse: When selecting wrapping paper, select paper which is durable. When wrapping gifts, use the kind of tape which can be removed easily without damaging the paper. Use minimal tape.\n2. Unwrap the gift for reuse, too. When the honoree unwraps each gift, have them do so carefully. Have them try to avoid damaging the paper. Once paper is removed, fold it carefully for reuse.\n3. Share the paper with several guests. If there are so many presents that the honoree ends up with more paper than they can re-use, share it among the people present for efficient re-use.\n\n\n## Use gift bag with a gift tag\n\n1. Purchase a nice gift bag (or reusable bag), rather than wrapping paper for each gift.\n2. Make and attach a large gift tag to the bottom of the bag covering the manufacturers name, etc. Include at least 12 rows on the tag. Write your name, email, occasion and date on the first row of the tag.\n3. Place gift item in bag and present to honoree as usual. After honoree removes the gift from the bag, they save the bag for the next occasion.\n4. When the honoree has an occasion to give a gift, they write their name, occasion and date on the first blank line on the tag.\n5. Repeat the re-use and gifting process 12 times.\n6. Have the twelfth person to receive the gift bag send an email to everyone listed on the tag with the bag's history. Assuming the bag remains in usable condition, they can then attach a new tag on top of the original tag and repeat the process.\n7. Keep the reuse and gifting chain going until the back is too worn to continue. Ultimately, recycle the bag.\n\n\n## Make a gift display rather than gift wrap\n\n1. Bring unwrapped gifts to the celebration.\n2. Place the gifts on a display table. Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.\n3. Prepare a one page log for the honoree. It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes. Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!\n4. When it is time to present the gifts, position the honoree behind the table along with the guests. Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts. (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)\n\n\n## Gift wrap (blindfold) the honoree instead of the gift\n\n1. If your honoree is adventuresome, blindfold them with an attractive looking bandana or blindfold prior to displaying or presenting any gifts.\n2. Present each gift to the blindfolded honoree while the people giving the gift stand behind them.\n3. Have the honoree identify the gift by feeling of it. If you want to make the task more challenging have the honoree wear attractive looking gloves or mittens while doing this. Optionally, have the honoree guess who gave them the gift.\n4. Of course, take numerous photos (and possibly video) of the gift giving process.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Purchase a nice gift bag.","max_prob":7.9055147171,"ccp":-0.1173025579},{"claim":"Purchase a reusable bag.","max_prob":10.8148212433,"ccp":-0.1199632554},{"claim":"Use a gift bag instead of wrapping paper for each gift.","max_prob":12.0756464005,"ccp":-0.7727927707},{"claim":"Make a large gift tag.","max_prob":10.9932460785,"ccp":-0.0031490283},{"claim":"Attach the large gift tag to the bottom of the bag.","max_prob":16.9997959137,"ccp":-0.0001155912},{"claim":"The gift tag covers the manufacturer's name, etc.","max_prob":23.3425369263,"ccp":-0.1611965098},{"claim":"A gift item is placed in a bag.","max_prob":15.1331510544,"ccp":-0.0016064865},{"claim":"The gift item is presented to the honoree.","max_prob":17.1194629669,"ccp":-0.8127434518},{"claim":"The presentation to the honoree is done as usual.","max_prob":14.0749197006,"ccp":-0.0079059355},{"claim":"The honoree removes the gift from the bag.","max_prob":7.8853440285,"ccp":-0.0439512924},{"claim":"The honoree saves the bag.","max_prob":10.3493022919,"ccp":-0.3263537239},{"claim":"The honoree saves the bag for the next occasion.","max_prob":17.1998977661,"ccp":-0.3201219233},{"claim":"The honoree has an occasion to give a gift.","max_prob":9.0895042419,"ccp":-0.3514640717},{"claim":"The honoree writes their name on the first blank line on the tag.","max_prob":14.8885755539,"ccp":-0.0208196979},{"claim":"The honoree writes the occasion on the first blank line on the tag.","max_prob":15.1147871017,"ccp":-0.0052584682},{"claim":"The honoree writes the date on the first blank line on the tag.","max_prob":13.4564886093,"ccp":-0.0160166001},{"claim":"Take photos of the covered table.","max_prob":15.3608961105,"ccp":-0.0017390825},{"claim":"Uncover the table.","max_prob":11.0441198349,"ccp":-0.0007786787},{"claim":"Photograph the table displaying the gifts.","max_prob":12.3809270859,"ccp":-0.0184807405},{"claim":"There is a table.","max_prob":3.0517935753,"ccp":-0.1534092207},{"claim":"The table can be uncovered.","max_prob":4.7757668495,"ccp":-0.1109018955},{"claim":"A video can be made of the table being uncovered.","max_prob":11.068318367,"ccp":-0.0790499039},{"claim":"There is a gift.","max_prob":0.2598926425,"ccp":-0.9416808763},{"claim":"There is a blindfolded honoree.","max_prob":1.9220005274,"ccp":-0.2025362041},{"claim":"There are people giving the gift.","max_prob":9.1997327805,"ccp":-0.7225629209},{"claim":"The gift is presented to the blindfolded honoree.","max_prob":10.1192674637,"ccp":-0.0140896138}]}
{"instruction":"How to promote your business on tiktok?","response":"For most people, TikTok is a fun way to kill time and share zany videos with friends. In the right hands, however, it can also be a useful promotional tool. Taking advantage of the app\u2019s unique format can help business owners get more eyes on their products and services, especially if they\u2019re aimed at a younger target audience.\n\n## Establish a presence\n\n1. Create an official TikTok account for your business. When you open the app for the first time, you\u2019ll be given the option to sign up using your phone number, email address, or a third-party platform like Facebook. Once you\u2019ve successfully created an account, tap the person-shaped icon in the lower righthand corner and hit \u201cEdit Profile\u201d to access your user settings. There, you can change your name, write out a custom bio, and upload a profile picture or video.You\u2019ll find TikTok listed near the top of the \u201cMost Downloaded\u201d section of your preferred app store.\n2. Build a profile that represents your business well. Start by choosing a distinctive profile picture that will make your account instantly identifiable. A logo, mascot, or photo of one of your products will work best in most cases. Then, draft a short bio that explains who you are, what you do, and why your followers should be interested.Be sure to include a link to your website or online store in your bio. That way, users will be able to find out more about your business just by visiting your profile.Tip: Asking yourself questions like, \u201cWho is my target audience?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I hoping to show my followers?\u201d, and, \u201cHow does this app fit in with my other marketing strategies?\u201d while you\u2019re tinkering with your profile can help you zero in a more effective presentation.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the app\u2019s basic format. While it offers a host of different features, TikTok is primarily a video sharing platform that lets users upload video clips up to 15 seconds in length. This rapid-fire setup forces content creators to find imaginative ways to capture their viewers\u2019 attention and make a statement fast.Users also have the option of setting their videos to popular songs and sound clips in order to make playful lip syncing videos, produce mini music videos, or just add a little extra style. If you have a longer video that you want to show, it\u2019s also possible to connect multiple segments that will play continuously for up to 60 seconds.\n4. Take advantage of the app\u2019s built-in editing features when posting videos. When you\u2019re ready to get creating, tap the \u201c+\u201d button in the bottom center of the screen. This will pull up the in-app camera, allowing you to shoot a video that\u2019s anywhere between 15 and 60 seconds in length. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have the option to trim your video, add stylish transitions, write custom captions, and layer on filters and other special effects.One of TikTok\u2019s most beloved features is the ability to add backing music and sound clips. Tap on the \u201cMusic\u201d icon in your editing dashboard to browse an absolutely massive library of hit songs from all eras. You can also hit the \u201cUpload\u201d icon to the right of the red \u201cRecord\u201d button to upload a video that you shot on your device earlier. This feature can be handy in those situations where you want to prepare a new post but don\u2019t have a lot of time to play around on the app.\n\n\n## Produce effective content\n\n1. Focus on putting together videos that are fun and engaging. TikTok is an unconventional app, so it\u2019s no place for conventional advertising. Spend some time coming up with ideas for posts that you think will pique your audience\u2019s interest, make them laugh, or encourage them to try out your product or service for themselves. The ultimate goal is for your brand to stick in their memory.Viral dance videos are all the rage on TikTok, so if you\u2019ve got some sweet moves up your sleeve, now\u2019s the time to show the world. Use this opportunity to get creative and think outside the advertising box\u2014crack jokes, incorporate chart-topping songs, or work in clever pop culture references that will help you gain traction with your audience. Anything goes!\n2. Make sure your content comes across as genuine. While there\u2019s a virtually unlimited number of ways to express your business\u2019s \u201cpersonality\u201d on TikTok, it\u2019s crucial that your content have a casual, down-to-earth feel to it. If it seems forced or insincere, your audience won\u2019t buy it\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re trying to get them to do.Old-fashioned ads rarely get a second look these days. But if you can highlight the exciting, adventurous, or playful aspects of your business in a way that makes users feel like they\u2019re a part of something, it\u2019s sure to get them talking. The kind of people who value the app\u2019s open-ended, creative format are notoriously hard to sway using traditional marketing strategies, and tend to appreciate businesses that seem relatable and take more of a down-to-earth approach.Tip: Forget about polished, overly formal sales pitches. TikTok culture is all about fun, spontaneity, and accessibility, with a strong \"DIY\" aesthetic.\n3. Create short product demonstrations. Make videos of yourself or your team members actually using the items you\u2019re advertising. This is a good chance to show your viewers just what your products can do, or to highlight any key features or intended uses it might have.A video of someone sipping an ice cold soft drink on the beach surrounded by friends, for instance, will be much more likely to make an impression on viewers than one showing someone drinking the same beverage alone in their kitchen. Remember, you only have 15 seconds, so you\u2019ll need to either edit together a montage of quick cuts or skip to the most impressive part of your demonstration in order to get your message across.\n4. Start a viral hashtag challenge. Come up with a unique way to get your audience to engage with a particular product or service, give it a catchy hashtag, and offer to share or repost select submissions from users who add the hashtag to their posts. Not only will this give them a chance to gain some exposure by being featured on your account, it will also ensure that your hashtag is spread far and wide.Imagine that you run a footwear company called Swiftz. You might challenge TikTok users to post videos of themselves wearing your shoes for their favorite activities with the hashtag, \u201c#SwiftzTakesMe.\u201d\n5. Encourage users to interact with your posts. Whenever you put up a new post, include a call-to-action to motivate viewers to like, comment, and share. Doing so will let them establish a kind of dialogue with your company, increasing its visibility in the process. On an app like TikTok, greater visibility means greater discoverability, which in turn means more customers.Prompts like, \u201cTell us which feature of our new jeans you like best in the comments!\u201d or, \u201cWhat other uses have you discovered for our infinitely-customizable storage cubes?\u201d give your audience a chance to take a more active role in your branding efforts. Another way to expand your reach is to ask viewers to post videos of themselves using your product or explaining what they like about it for a shot at a repost, similar to hashtag challenge.\n\n\n## Buy ad space on tiktok\n\n1. Publish in-feed native content. In-feed native ads are video ads that pop up periodically between regular user videos. When you post one of these ads, it will appear as a full-screen, skippable video, similar to branded stories on Instagram. This is the most straightforward way to advertise on TikTok, and probably the one that promises the most visibility overall.If you\u2019re interested in making use of TikTok\u2019s ad service, you\u2019ll need to work with one of the company\u2019s marketing reps, who will provide you with all the info you need regarding pricing, structure, and targeting. Once your ad has been posted, you can track its outreach by reviewing a number of different metrics, including clicks, views, play duration, and interactions like comments and shares.Tip: While building your ad, you\u2019ll have the option of including links to your website, online store, or app, as well as hashtags that users can click on to see similar content.\n2. Stage a brand takeover. Brand takeovers are large-scale social media marketing campaigns that allow brands to \u201ctake over\u201d an app for a single day. What this means is that your business\u2019s branding elements will be displayed on the app\u2019s home screen for 24 hours. During that time, you can also use the app\u2019s creative features to mass-distribute targeted content containing clickable hashtags and embedded links to your website or product pages.For more information on pricing and availability, get in touch with a TikTok marketing rep by visiting the Advertising section of the company\u2019s website. There are also \u201cTop View\u201d takeover packages available that transition directly into 15-second in-feed video ads from the home screen.\n3. Pay for promoted hashtags. Promoted hashtags essentially accomplish the same thing as homegrown hashtag challenges. The main difference is that instead of relying on your audience to spread word of your challenge, TikTok will market it for you through targeted posts. Needless to say, it has the potential to find its way around to a lot more users this way.Having TikTok share your business\u2019s hashtags can seriously increase your web traffic, but it definitely isn\u2019t cheap. By some estimates, purchasing a promoted hashtag could run you as much as $150,000!\n4. Apply for your own branded lenses. Lenses are editing features that enable TikTok users to enhance their images and videos by adding special effects, much like the filters on Snapchat and Instagram. Users who try out your lenses will be sending a subtle message to their followers to check out your business. The more people you can get using your lenses, the more name recognition you stand to earn yourself.If you opt to go this route, you\u2019ll work closely with TikTok\u2019s marketing experts to develop lenses based on some aspect of your business\u2019s branding. Ideally, your lenses should offer users a cool new effect or look to play around with, not just plaster your name or logo everywhere. Don\u2019t forget that your objective is to actually get people to use it.\n5. Work with well-known influencers to grow your audience faster. One of the best ways to generate a buzz when you\u2019re just starting out is to collaborate with users who already have a dedicated following. If you come across a particular TikTok star who you think might make a good promotional partner, reach out to them via direct message and see if they would be interested in joining forces.Keep in mind that the most influential figures on social media are usually professionals, so you should be prepared to provide compensation if you want to hitch a ride on their reputation. With the right spokesperson, you could see an explosion in your follower numbers and outside web traffic literally overnight.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to respond to unsolicited advice?","response":"When someone gives you unsolicited advice, it can be tricky to know how to respond, no matter how well-intentioned it is. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but you also may not want to leave room for further advice. Sometimes, all you can do is politely acknowledge the advice and move forward. In other cases, however, you may need to shut the advice-giver down for crossing a boundary, or even leave the conversation.\n\n## Keep your cool\n\n1. Try to remember that the person is probably just trying to be helpful. They may not realize when they overstep their bounds, and they might hope that you will genuinely benefit from their advice. Sometimes, unsolicited advice just means that the person cares about you and wants to make your life easier. It is easy to take unsolicited advice as criticism. While this can be true, take their perspective into account and try to see if they are offering genuine, yet misguided support.\n2. Take a moment to put yourself in the other person's shoes. While it does not excuse their rude behavior, keep in mind that people often give unsolicited advice because they feel the need to be heard, or because it's what they're used to receiving from other people. Think about what may have led this person to share a piece of advice you did not need. Some examples of experiences that might lead someone to give unsolicited advice are feeling unheard while growing up, going through a difficult time and projecting their own problems onto you, or they feel undermined in other areas of their life and give advice to feel more competent. In other cases, the person may feel more powerful by giving advice that no one asked for, or they may be overconfident in their abilities. Gender is another factor, as men tend to give women more unsolicited advice, often as a result of undervaluing their skills.\n3. Maintain a sense of humor. It\u2019s often easiest to smile or laugh off unsolicited advice. By having a sense of humor about the situation, you can put yourself in the right frame of mind to shrug off the comment. For small, harmless suggestions, especially from strangers, put the situation in perspective and let your humor guide your response. Think about how the situation will make a funny story to tell your friends later, or how absurd it is for someone to think you might not know how to do a simple task. You can convey good-natured humor in your response out of politeness, even when you find the suggestion silly or ignorant. By saying something like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great idea! Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d you may be enabling them to continue to offer unprompted advice, but it can help you avoid conflict.\n4. Avoid the impulse to lash out. It is easy to feel defensive when you receive unsolicited advice, in part because it can feel like the other person doesn\u2019t trust you to handle things themselves. Sarcasm and criticism can make the person who gave you advice feel victimized, however, as they most likely won\u2019t see what they did wrong. Think about your relationship with the person. Especially if they are a friend or family member, you may not want to upset them. When interacting with a stranger, it can be easy to be dismissive or rude, but try responding in a firm, yet polite way if laughing off the advice doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## Move on with the conversation\n\n1. Hear the advice-giver out. In many cases, the person just wants to feel heard or contribute to the conversation. Let them say their piece, even if it's unhelpful or completely wrong. They'll probably feel better once they finish talking and often just stop. Once they have finished, the conversation can move on.\n2. Acknowledge the advice and move on. Sometimes the easiest thing to do is nod, smile, say okay, and go ahead with your plans anyway. Particularly if the person is in a position of power, you might feel obligated to thank them before moving forward or changing the subject. \"Thank you. I'll consider that.\" \"Let me write that down so I can think it over.\" \"I already have a plan for handling this, but thank you for your perspective. I'll take it into consideration.\"\n3. Turn it into a joke about yourself. A little humor can turn around an awkward situation. If you think of something silly to say, try saying it out loud. The two of you might be able to have a good laugh and move on. \"If you think my desk is messy, you should see my bedroom. Some of my clothes have probably fossilized by now.\" \"You know me. I love carbs far too much to change my diet.\" \"I would, but my husband banned me from the kitchen after the second time I set myself on fire.\"\n4. Address their motive, if they have one. Sometimes people who give advice have an ulterior motive (for better or for worse). If you can tell that an advice-giver is hoping you'll do something that makes them happy, try offering an alternative or addressing it directly. \"Are you trying to make an excuse to spend more time with me? Because you don't need one! Are you free this weekend?\" \"I know that it's been a big change since I moved away from home. I enjoy living in the city, so I plan to stay there. Why don't we set some dates for you to come visit?\"\n5. Ask a question to switch to a new topic. Changing the subject by asking a question can be a good way to distract a person who was piling on advice. Try asking about them, or about something you know they're interested in. This way, they're likely to stay engaged in the new topic. \"I'll keep that in mind. But enough about me. How was your day?\" \"My partner and I are going to make all our birthing decisions together. Do you know of any good parent and me classes?\" \"Thanks for the advice! You mentioned having two dogs. What are their names?\"\n6. Turn down the advice politely if the person doesn't get the hint.. Try to keep it positive by saying that it isn't right for you personally, while acknowledging that it could be right for them or someone else. This will help the other person realize that they gave advice you didn\u2019t ask for. \"Thank you for trying to help, but I may have given the wrong impression. I'm not looking for advice right now.\" \"I've tried that, but I found that it doesn't help me personally.\" \"I'll make treatment decisions with my doctor.\" \"That's not in line with my personal values.\"\n\n\n## Confront the advice-giver\n\n1. Express your discomfort if the advice-giver crosses a line. Sometimes, people say things that are downright rude, mean, or overly familiar. In that case, you may want to tell them that they've offended you or hurt your feelings. Try to make \"I\" statements (e.g. \"I'm upset\") instead of a \"you\" statement (e.g. \"you're rude\") so that you don't put them on the defensive. One way to shut down a piece of unwanted advice would be to say, \"I feel upset about this line of conversation. Let's please change the subject.\"\n2. Set a boundary with a regular advice-giver. If someone is repeatedly trying to give advice when it's not what you want, you may want to express your frustration in a constructive way. You can set a boundary in the conversation, or in general, if the person has a track record of offering unsolicited advice. For a specific instance of needing to set a boundary you could say, \"I know you're trying to help, but I really just need a listening ear right now,\" or simply \"I'm not looking for advice at the moment.\" If someone has been giving you unsolicited advice for weeks, months, or years, try saying something like, \u201cI often feel like you try to help in ways that show you don\u2019t trust me to help myself,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for advice if I need to, but I need you to let me talk about this without trying to help.\u201d\n3. Exit the conversation if needed. Sometimes people pile on unsolicited advice despite your attempts to redirect the conversation or set a boundary. In these situations, it may be easier to leave the conversation for a minute or end the conversation altogether. \"Please excuse me. I remembered\u2026 \"\n\t* \"I need to get going now so I'm not late.\" \"I need to get to an appointment. It was nice talking to you!\"\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to deal with a job loss?","response":"Losing your job can take a toll on your well-being, finances, and self-worth. When dealing with a job loss, work through the stress by finding healthy and productive outlets. Address your finances and make necessary changes to budgeting and spending. Developing healthy habits can help you feel better and get you closer to re-entering the job market. While dealing with a job loss can be difficult, you can have a positive experience during your transition and even enjoy some of the changes you make.\n\n## Cop with stress from lose your job\n\n1. Allow yourself to experience grief. Losing a job is much more than losing your source of income. Your job may be a source of your identity and bring you personal and professional fulfillment. It\u2019s normal to experience grief, so allow yourself to feel it. Accept whatever feelings come and know that they will not last forever. Pushing your emotions down or pretending they don\u2019t exist will likely result in them coming up at another time, whether you like it or not. So, when you feel anger, sadness, hopelessness, or grief, let it be and don\u2019t push it away.\n2. Use effective coping strategies. Dealing with a job loss will undeniably lead to stress. Cope with your stress by engaging in activities that make you feel good and relieve your stress in a healthy way. Find an activity that relaxes you and helps you feel calm. Engage in relaxing activities such as yoga, meditation, or journaling. Avoid using alcohol, drugs, or other harmful substances as a way to cope.\n3. Ask for emotional support from loved ones. While your loved ones can\u2019t solve your problems, they can support you and lend a listening ear while you sort out your life. Find someone you trust and talk about your struggles and ask for support. You don\u2019t need to go through your problems alone. Keeping your job loss a secret can make things worse. Know that there are people you can talk to and who will support you.\n4. Focus on what you can control. You can\u2019t control your job loss or when you will get a new job. You won\u2019t know when an employer will call you back or how many interviews you will get. Instead of focusing on things outside of your control, focus on what you can control, such as getting training, taking care of yourself, and surrounding yourself with positive influences. Think of what is within your control when you feel overwhelmed or stressed out.\n5. Find joy through a hobby or activity. If you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself and the time you have, find activities that feel fulfilling. Try volunteering at an animal shelter or after-school program for children. Pick up a hobby that\u2019s fun and fulfilling such as painting, dancing, woodworking, or traveling. Losing your job can make you feel like your sense of meaning is gone. Finding an enjoyable activity can help you experience some joy and fulfillment outside of work.\n\n\n## Handle financial matter\n\n1. Apply for financial assistance. Depending on where you live, you may be able to access government assistance when you become unemployed. Go to your local employment services department in your state or territory to see if you qualify for workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, medical assistance and insurance, financial assistance for food, and other benefits that can help in this difficult time. You can usually walk in and talk to someone the same day. Bring documents from your previous employer that outline your pay, insurance, benefits, etc. Assistance services can take time to get started, so apply for them as soon as you lose your job.\n2. Maintain a budget. If you\u2019re not already using a budget, now is the perfect time to create one. Your goal for a budget while unemployed is to save money and reduce your overall expenses. Create categories for your spending such as food, car, rent\/mortgage, pet care, or anything else that\u2019s pertinent. Allocate money to each category and stay within the limit you set! Creating a budget will help you prioritize where your money goes and how much you will spend on different items. For example, set up a $200 budget each month for food and start buying foods that are healthy and will fill you up. Skip the restaurants and fancy foods and focus on getting your basic needs met.\n3. Save money. Your goal right now is to have enough money to get by and not worry about finances while you look for your next job. Cut back on extra expenses by making small changes, such as choosing a cheaper mobile phone plan or cancelling your gym membership if you\u2019ve stopped going. Look for small things you can cut out that won\u2019t affect you too much. For example, use generic products instead of branded items. Avoid buying books or movies. Instead, visit your local library to borrow them. Your library may even have other items available for loan, depending on how well-supported the library system is in your area.\n4. Stop unnecessary purchases. Losing a job often means a drastic cut in income or no source of income at all. Cut back on any unnecessary spending. For example, if you subscribe to a monthly magazine or promotional box, cancel it. If you eat out for most meals, consider cooking at home. These are simple ways to cut spending that can help you with financial stability. Find ways that you can cut spending without having to make drastic changes. For example, limit your online shopping. Make a list of your monthly expenses and determine if there are some you can eliminate or decrease. For example, some cable companies will allow you to decrease your monthly plan to a very basic plan for a lot less money for up to 6 months at a time.\n5. Make some extra money. If you\u2019re struggling to make ends meet, there are some easy ways to make money quickly. Look around and find items in your home that you\u2019re willing to part with in order to make some money. This might include clothes, electronics, books, or jewelry. If you have a spare bedroom in your home, consider renting it out to someone. Sign up with a rideshare company and offer rides locally when you have time. Look at freelancing job sites online. Some, such as Upwork, Guru, and Remote have a lot of different types of work that people are willing to pay you to do. While making some extra money takes some effort, it can pay off and make you feel more comfortable while you\u2019re unemployed.\n\n\n## Keep a healthy lifestyle\n\n1. Keep a daily routine. Not having a job can mean that days feel like they stretch on forever or that you waste time only to realize that the day is over. Create a daily schedule or routine that helps you accomplish your goals and stay productive. Have a set time that you start and end your day so that you keep a general routine. For example, wake up at the same time each morning and keep a regular morning routine. Go to the gym, then start your job search. It might help to get out of the house when you do work.\n2. Get good sleep. Sleep often suffers when under stress, so keep good sleeping habits while dealing with your job loss. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Keep electronics out of your bedroom so the light does not disrupt your sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, try a relaxation routine before bedtime. For example, take a bath, drink a soothing herbal tea, or journal as a way to relax and ready yourself for sleep.\n3. Eat healthy foods. The food you put in your body may be easily overlooked, but it\u2019s especially important to healthfully fuel yourself when dealing with the stress of job loss. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains such as brown rice and oats. Eat high-quality protein sources such as tempeh. Avoid foods that influence your mood, which might include sugar, caffeine, and high levels of preservatives or hormones. If you struggle with anxiety, stay away from nicotine and caffeine, which can increase anxiety.\n4. Talk with a counselor. A counselor can provide guidance and support while you are dealing with your job loss. For example, if you\u2019re struggling with how to move forward or handle your stress, see a therapist to help. If you need help in gaining some direction with your career, consider seeing a career counselor. Find a counselor by calling your insurance provider or the employment center near you. You could also try talking to a career counselor. Career counselors can help you determine if the career you have is the right fit for you. Perhaps this is an opportunity to try something else.\n\n\n## Take step forward for your career\n\n1. Decide how you want to move forward. Losing your job might be a new beginning. Decide whether you want to continue in your career path or make some changes. You might want to take your career in a different direction or go back to school. Now is your chance for a new beginning should you want it. Knowing what you want can help you apply for jobs or get training that you need for a different position.\n2. Treat finding a job as a job. Make finding employment your full-time job. This can help you stay motivated and on task while between jobs. Break up your day as you would at your last job so that you have tasks to complete, deadlines to meet, and different activities to do. For example, spend time looking through job listings, making phone calls, and writing emails. Then, spend your afternoon revising your resume, doing some reading or completing training. Devote your time to finding your next job and get serious about it. Start by researching the jobs and companies you are interested in working for. Then create separate resumes for each type of job you would like. Use recruiting companies. There are many recruiters looking for people to fill jobs of all kinds all over the world, and they have access to job databases that the general public cannot access. Some companies even hire exclusively through recruiters. By sending your resume to recruiters and following up with them regularly, you can increase your chances of being considered for jobs you may not be aware of.\n3. Build your marketable skills. Take classes that can help you improve your business skills. Look for classes at your local employment center, park district, or on the internet. Gaining knowledge and skills that employers want can help you get a leg up once you submit your resume. Getting training can also show that you are current in your skills. Look for training that offers certificates, certifications, or other credentials that you can add to your resume for proof that you completed them. EdX is a great source for free online classes, and they offer certificates and credits. Visit https:\/\/www.edx.org\/.\n4. Network with others in your field. Attend events, conferences, and lunches where you can meet other professionals and employers. Attend meetups geared toward professionals in your field. Look up job fairs and attend ones that interest you. The more connections you have, the better your odds of finding the job you want.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to identify a bandwagon fan?","response":"Ever notice how people \"suddenly\" become fans of teams that are performing well? Do you ever wonder if they are \"real fans\" like they claim to be? Or do you wonder if they're just bandwagon fans? Bandwagon fans are defined as sports fans who have shown no past loyalty to a team, and who only support them when they are doing well. While people may not admit to being bandwagon fans, there are easy ways to spot them.\n\n## Listen to what they say\n\n1. See if they know the staff. True fans of a team will know the names of more than just the star player on the team. See if they know other players, coaches, owners, and former players. This will help determine if they have any loyalty towards the team. Knowing the play-makers is great. But a true fan needs to know more than the offensive players. They need to know what's going on on both sides of the ball. Not every fan follows what goes on behind the scenes so cut them some slack if they don't know the athletic trainer or the newest draft picks.\n2. Determine if they know statistics. Knowing statistics takes both time and effort. Do they know the average number of points scored per game? Do they know where the team ranks offensively and defensively? True fans always find ways to track the progress of their favorite team. Their knowledge should go beyond stats for the star player or the team's record. They should be able to discuss the teams status as if they were commentators for ESPN, because it is both informative and entertaining for real fans.\n3. See if they know any historical information about the team. It's easy to know about a team's current progress, but it's more difficult to know about the history of a team. A fan who has been loyal for years will know past players, championship years, and significant games. Many fans will also have personal stories associated with the team. For example, they'll know exactly where they were when the Houston Rockets won back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995. Many bandwagon fans only follow teams who have been successful over the last few years and will not know history that stretches beyond the team's current winning streak.\n4. Count how many teams they support. Fake fans usually divide their loyalty among more than one team. The more teams they support, the less of a true fan they are. Choosing a favorite sports team is like choosing a wife--you can only have one. In different sports, there are rules about teams you cannot support at the same time. For example, in baseball, you can't root for both the Yankees and the Mets. In football, you can't cheer for both the Texans and the Cowboys.\n5. Listen to their reasons for supporting the team. Most of the time loyalty to a team is determined by where you grew up or the player you idolized growing up. Bandwagon fans usually have flimsy excuses for why they support a team. For example, reasons such as liking the team logo, having a boyfriend or girlfriend that supports the team, or picking the team are not viable reasons. If your favorite team relocates to a different city then it is your choice to turn back on them or not. If you grew up in a city that didn't have a team for a specific sport, you're then able to pick a team (with good reason of course). If your team eventually gets a new franchise, it is your choice to stick with your current team, or start to follow the new one.\n6. See if they only support the best teams in the league. If the fan only supports the #1 teams in football, baseball, basketball, soccer or other major league sports, they are likely not supporting the team but supporting the winning streak. There will be times when your favorite team will consistently be successful, but it's a strange phenomenon when ALL of the teams you support are doing well. For example, it's perfectly acceptable to support the New England Patriots and their success. But to support them, the Boston Red Sox, the Golden State Warriors, and the Washington Capitals at the same time is a sign of being a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Watch what they do\n\n1. Notice if they go to games only when the team is successful. It's difficult to support a team when they are in a slump, but real fans do just that. Even if a real fan curses their team, they are there to support them the next game. Bandwagon fans jump off the wagon at the first sign of trouble. Going to a game takes more effort and more money. Bandwagon fans don't want to invest either if the team isn't doing well. The same is true of watching games on television.\n2. Ask why they leave the game early. True fans stay at a game until the bitter end--even if they know the result will be less than desirable. On the other hand, bandwagon fans tend to walk out and stop offering support to the team. Bandwagon fans often miss out on some of the best comebacks in sports because they choose to walk out during tough times. For example, in the 2013 NBA Finals in game six when the Miami Heat were down against the San Antonio Spurs, fans left early and missed out on a comeback. Also, in the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks, they trailed so fans left the game early and missed out on an amazing onside kick recovery to eventually win the game and go to Super Bowl XLIX.\n3. Determine if they go to live games. If you don't cheer for the team in the area you grew up in, in favor of a team far away, that's one thing. But true fans still go to live sporting events for the experience of being around like-minded, passionate individuals. Bandwagon fans don't value the experience because they aren't as emotionally invested as real fans. Even if it means braving the cold or paying for over-priced beer, real fans will try to attend at least one game during the season. Some bandwagon fans will attend a game or two just to be able to say that they have. They are unlikely to attend games that aren't convenient. For example, when the weather is bad, when the tickets are too pricey, or when the game falls on a workday.\n4. See if they support the team only during playoffs. This has a bit to do with the team being successful, but it also has to do with the importance of the game. Regular seasons in sports tend to be long and grueling, so bandwagon fans like to skip the regular season games and jump right to the good part. Playoff games occur after the regular season and are tournament style games that lead up to the championship. Playoffs also bring out bandwagon fans whose \"first choice\" didn't make the playoffs. In order to have someone to root for, they will choose a team randomly and only for that season.\n5. Determine if they jump off the wagon. This is also known as wavering in their support of the team. If a fan stops supporting their team if they lose a playoff game, championship game, or don't make the playoffs at all, they're exhibiting behavior consistent with that of a bandwagon fan.\n\n\n## Identify a true fan\n\n1. See if they own a throwback jersey. A throwback jersey is one that duplicates a jersey worn by a team or player from the past. Real fans tend to purchase throwback jerseys (along side more modern sports gear) because they actually know the history of the team and its players. On the contrary, bandwagon fans typically purchase team gear that represents the more modern logos, colors, and players. True fans are also more likely to spend big bucks on team gear and throwbacks are usually more authentic and costly.\n2. Notice if they ever boo their team. True fans will never boo their team because they are trying to inspire them, not make them feel worse. It's okay to be angry with a less than perfect performance, but making your team feel like trash won't help. Real fans stick with their team for better or for worse.\n3. Determine if they support their team's players more than any others. A true fan's loyalty is always to his or her team first. That doesn't mean that they can't support or like other players, but it does mean that their loyalty lies with their team's players first. For example, it's fine to appreciate great players like Peyton Manning but if you're a New England Patriots fan you support Tom Brady first. Additionally, if you have players who are on your fantasy football team but are not on your favorite football team, you can support them only as far as it doesn't interfere with your favorite team's success.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Bandwagon fans are defined as sports

{"instruction":"How to match paint colors?","response":"Whether you need to touch up a scratch on your living room wall or your child wants their bedroom to be the exact same color as their favorite toy, it can be difficult to find a perfect match to an existing paint color. Luckily, there are plenty of tricks and tools that can help you find the color you\u2019re looking from, including using paint samples, smartphone apps, and in-store computerized color matching!\n\n## Match paint without a sample\n\n1. Clean the area you're trying to paint match. Over time, fingerprints, dust, and dirt can collect on the surface of an object or a wall, and this can make the paint color seem darker than it actually is. To make sure you're testing the actual color, wipe the paint down with a damp, soapy sponge, and allow it to dry completely before you try to match the color. In addition to giving you a more accurate color match, cleaning the wall will help the new paint adhere better.\n2. Scrape off a 1 in (2.5 cm) sample of drywall paint with a razor knife. If you\u2019re trying to match paint on sheetrock or drywall, the easiest way to get a perfect match is to bring a sample with you to the paint store. Use a utility knife to score a square into the surface of the sheetrock about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) deep, then peel away the paper. Place the sample in a plastic bag or an envelope so it doesn\u2019t get smudged before you get to the paint store. Once the store has analyzed the color, dab a little of the paint onto a corner of the sample and let it dry to ensure it\u2019s a perfect match.\n3. Bring the item you\u2019re matching to the paint store if it's portable. Thanks to the computerized color-matching technology at most paint stores, you can match almost anything! If you\u2019re trying to find a paint that\u2019s the same color as an object, you can bring that object in with you when you go to buy paint. The staff at the paint store will then scan the item and come up with an exact or near-exact digital match to the color of the object. If there\u2019s not an existing color that matches your object, the paint store can mix one up for you.\n\n\n## Find a match with an app\n\n1. Download a paint-matching app if you can\u2019t take a sample. Most major paint brands have their own apps for matching paint colors, including Sherwin-Williams, BEHR, Glidden, and Valspar. Visit the app store on your smartphone and choose an app that will scan your wall color and provide you with a color match. If you remember the brand you used originally, download their app. If you don\u2019t know the brand, try a few different apps to see which gives you the closest match, or try an app like Paint My Place which uses multiple paint brands.\n2. Scan your paint in natural lighting for the best result. Differences in lighting can make your paint more yellow or more blue, depending on which type of light is being used. To avoid these inconsistencies, try to test your paint sample in an area with plenty of natural light if you can, like near an open window or door. Since natural light changes throughout the day, it may help to take a color reading in the morning, afternoon, and evening. If your room doesn\u2019t have much natural light, use the room\u2019s primary light source to test the paint. Incandescent lights will make paint seem warmer, while fluorescent lights look cooler. Halogen bulbs more closely resemble daylight.\n3. Test the paint in an inconspicuous area to make sure it\u2019s a good match. Differences in lighting and cameras can make digital paint matching imprecise. If you purchase paint based on the results you get from an app, be sure to test it somewhere where the difference won\u2019t be obvious. Let the paint dry completely before you check whether it\u2019s a match, since wet paint can look like a different color at first.\n4. Purchase or borrow a color scanner for a more precise match. Apps rely on your smartphone\u2019s camera to get a color match, but you can get more accurate results with a small device that scans paint colors using an independent camera with its own lighting. If you\u2019ll be doing a lot of color matching, it can be worth the investment. These color scanners are $65-$100 at most home stores and connect to your phone via Bluetooth.\n\n\n## Use a color sample\n\n1. Take a picture of the original color before you go to the paint store. If you\u2019re planning to pick up color samples from the paint store, take along a photo of the original paint. Pictures won\u2019t give you an exact color match, but they can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to remember the general hue. If you can, try snapping pictures at different times of day, since the changes in lighting will make the paint look different. If you\u2019re in a hurry and don\u2019t have time to wait a few hours for the light to change, try taking pictures with the flash on and off, or with the main light on, followed by lamplight. Holding up a true white piece of paper or cardstock in the picture can help your camera to automatically correct the color balance.\n2. Choose a handful of samples to bring home with you. The lighting in the paint aisle won\u2019t be the same as it is in your home, and different shades can seem really similar, so it\u2019s important to bring the paint samples to the wall to compare the colors. Choose a handful of colors that seem close to the shade you want to match. If you\u2019re not sure what brand the original color was, be sure to get shades from several different brands, as well. If you like, you can also purchase or borrow a fan deck of colors from the paint store so you\u2019ll have access to all of the shades a particular brand offers.\n3. Tape the samples to the wall and examine them at different times of day. It can be tempting to just hold up the samples and immediately choose which one is the closest, but since the color of the room will change slightly as the sun moves throughout the day, you should hang the samples and come back to them every couple of hours. Of course, if none of the samples are a match, you will probably be able to tell right away. If one sample is a match early in the day and another matches better in the evening, ask the paint store if they can mix a shade in between.\n4. Paint a small section of each color on the wall if you\u2019re still not sure. Most paint stores will sell you a small can of paint that you can use to paint a sample. If you can\u2019t decide between 2 or 3 different shades, purchase a sample size of each. Paint a small swatch of each color onto the wall and look at them for a few days before making your final decision. In addition to changes in light throughout the day, changes in weather can also affect your paint color. Your swatches might look different on a sunny day than they do on a day when that\u2019s overcast.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"There are

{"instruction":"How to make a cat tree?","response":"Cats are natural climbers, and will happily crawl all over tall structures. A homemade cat tree will provide your kitty with hours of entertainment, and can be built at a fraction of the cost of cat trees available at a pet store. With some tools and dedication, you can make a customized cat tree based on your cat's personality!\n\n## Build a cat tree from wood and carpet\n\n1. Design your cat tree. Before purchasing materials or starting to build, you need a design plan, which you can sketch out on a piece of paper to determine your materials shopping list. There are several things to consider when designing your cat tree. First, consider your space limitations. Determine where your cat tree will be placed, and what size will fit well into that space. It's a good idea to take measurements to ensure your finished product will fit the space. You should also consider your cat's personality. If your cat likes to climb, consider building a tall cat tree with several perches. If your cat would like a private place to hide or sleep, consider building in a covered sleeping nook. Finally, you should keep your carpentry skills in mind. If you are relatively inexperienced with building things and using tools, keep your design simple so that you aren't overwhelmed. If you're at a loss for where to begin, there are several websites that have pictures of do-it-yourself cat trees you can use for inspiration, or even patterns for cat trees other people have made.\n2. Buy your materials. Use your design plan to determine which materials you will need. Plywood works well for horizontal platforms; dimensional lumber and cardboard or PVC pipe work well for vertical supports, and carpet is ideal for covering the wood. You may also need the following tools to assemble your tree:\n\t* A drill and some wood screws\n\t* An electric stapler\n\t* A table saw and a handsaw\n\t* A Hammer and nails\n\t* A carpet or utility knife\n\t* Wood glue or another powerful adhesive\n\t* If you want to create covered areas for your cat to perch, you may also want to pick up a concrete form tube. These heavy-duty cardboard tubes make great perches and tunnels for cats. These can also be cut lengthwise using a utility knife to create concave platforms or open-topped beds for your cat.\n3. Cut all materials to size. Using your plan as a guide, cut all the plywood and lumber sections to size. A simple hand saw works well for cutting dimensional lumber, while a handheld circular saw or table saw is better for cutting sheets of plywood. Sand rough edges if desired.\n4. Build the base of your cat tree. The tree needs a sturdy base, which should extend farther out from the center than any other platform or component of the tree in order to prevent tipping. To make the base, a good option is to cut 2 squares of plywood to size and glue them together for extra thickness. A 24\" (60 cm) square works well for a basic cat tree, but the taller your tree, the larger you'll want to make the base, to ensure it is sturdy.\n5. Cover the base in carpet. Before attaching any vertical supports, it's best to cover the base with carpet or a thick upholstery fabric. Cut the carpet to size, making it a few inches larger than the base on all sides. Then, wrap its edges over the edges of the plywood base, and staple it in place on the underside of the base with a staple gun. You may need to cut small notches in the carpet at the corners to make it fold neatly beneath the base.\n6. Attach the vertical supports to the base. The vertical supports that will hold up your platforms can be attached to the base with screws, nails, bolts or wood glue. Flip the base over so the carpeted side is face down. Then, drill holes through the underside of the base in the spots where you want the supports to be. Attach the supports by inserting screws or nails through the holes and driving them into the supports. You may want to cover the supports with carpet before attaching them, as this will be easier than doing it after they are already secured in place. To make your cat tree double as a scratching post, wrap one or more of the supports in sisal rope, securing each end with wire brads or staples, placed where they will be out view and won't be scratched by the cat. If you use staples, you may need to tap them down with a hammer to make sure they don't stick out too much.\n7. Attach the horizontal perches to the supports. The plywood perches can be attached using wood screws and\/or gluing them to the tops of the vertical members. Wrap them in carpet or fabric after affixing them, so that the screws aren't visible through the carpet, and staple the carpet in place on the underside as you did with the base.\n8. Continue building according to your design. Continue to affix each component, referring back to your plan for measurements and placement. Adjustments to your design can be made as you go to account for stability issues, new ideas, or incorrect measurements.\n\n\n## Build a cat tree from a ladder\n\n1. Obtain a ladder. For this simple, unique cat tree, you'll need an old wooden ladder. Look around at garage sales, thrift furniture stores, and antique stores for one 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 m) high. Choose an old-fashioned ladder that looks like an upside-down \"v\" with several steps on either side that are at matching levels. It's fine if the wood looks old, but make sure the foundation of the ladder isn't too rickety. You want to be certain your cat tree won't tip over and hurt your cat. Try to find a ladder that's around four feet tall. A very tall ladder my be less stable or too tall for your cat.\n2. Gather your supplies. The ladder is going to be the base of the tree, but you'll need to alter it a bit to make it more cat friendly. Gather these supplies:\n\t* A piece of plywood long and wide enough to rest on two rungs of the ladder at the same level. This will provide a platform for your cat. If you want more than one platform, you'll need more than one piece of plywood. A hammer and 2\" nails\n\t* Carpet\n\t* An electric staple gun\n\t* A piece of canvas, denim, or other sturdy fabric you can use to create a hammock between the two bottom rungs\n\t* A can of paint (optional)\n\t* A toy that hangs from a piece of rope or string\n\t* Sisal rope to wrap around the legs of the ladder\n3. Sand and paint your ladder and wood pieces. Use fine-grain sandpaper to sand down the ladder and remove any jagged edges or splinters. Do the same to the pieces of plywood you bought. Paint the ladder and plywood pieces with a coat or two of paint, if you're using it. Let the paint dry completely. Use your imagination when it comes time to paint. You could just paint the ladder to match your existing decor. But you could also paint it brown and green to make it look like a tree, or use stencils to make designs up and down the sides. Instead of painting the platforms, you can make them more comfortable for you cat by covering them in carpet, attaching it to to the platforms after nailing them into place. Use your staple gun and affix the carpet with staples in the perimeter and in the center. Make sure they don't stick up from the platform, tapping them down with a hammer if necessary.\n4. Nail the plywood platforms to the ladder. Position the first piece of plywood so that it is lined up across two ladder rungs of equal height. Use the hammer and four nails to nail the plywood into the wooden rungs, placing one nail in each corner of the plywood. Make sure the platforms are very secure when you're finished nailing them down. You may wish to use more nails, or substitute wood screws for a firmer hold. If you have a second piece of plywood to create another level, use the same procedure to nail it down.\n5. Install the hammock. Many cats enjoy sleeping in hammocks. If you'd like to add one to your cat tree, measure and cut your piece of cloth so that its four corners stretch between the four legs of the ladder. Nail or staple a corner of the fabric to the inside of each leg, making sure that the nails are all at the exact same height. Be sure the fabric you use for the hammock is thick enough to hold the weight of your cat. You can double the fabric or hem the edges before nailing it down to make it sturdier. Fabric that stretches a little is ideal for cat hammocks. Make sure nails or staples do not protrude in such a way that your cat could be scratched or cut. Tap your staples with hammer if necessary. Instead of a hammock, you can also use a carpeted concrete form tube, fastened to the ladder by attaching it to two 2X4 pieces of lumber secured to the base of the ladder with bolts, nails, or screws, between the legs. This will make your cat tree less portable, but also sturdier.\n6. Wrap the ladder legs in rope. If you want the cat tree to double as a scratching post, you can wrap the bottom of the ladder legs in strong, coarse rope. Cut the rope in four pieces. Use staples to secure the end of the first piece of rope to the inside of the base of one of the legs. Wrap the leg tightly with rope, tapping it down with a hammer if necessary. Secure the other end with a staple, making sure it is away from any areas the cat is most likely to scratch often. Repeat with the other four legs. If you want to, you can cover the legs entirely with rope, from top to bottom, using a new piece of rope between each rung of the ladder. This will allow your cat access to a scratchable surface nearly anywhere on its new cat tree.\n7. Finish up. Hang the toy you bought from the top of the ladder, somewhere the cat will be able to reach it, so as to entice your cat to come and play. Add any other finishing touches you want to make your cat tree unique and fun for your cat.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to create a strong burning charcoal fire?","response":"It may seem intimidating to start and maintain a strong fire, especially when charcoal is involved. However, with some basic equipment and knowledge of charcoal, anyone can have a professional BBQ going!\n\n## Use a chimney starter\n\n1. Use a chimney starter for an even, strong fire with minimal effort. Chimney starters are the easiest way to get a good charcoal fire, and you won't need any lighter fluid, either. You put paper in the bottom, fill the rest of the chimney with charcoal, and light the paper on fire. The heat is contained in the chimney, allowing all the charcoal to quickly catch fire before you dump it onto the grill to use for cooking. Chimney starters are usually between $15-$30, depending on size, and can be found online or in hardware stores. Most professional BBQ chefs and cooks highly recommend buying a chimney starter, as lighter fluid can influence smoke flavor and is harder to use when making an even heat fire.\n2. Place 2-4 pieces of lightly scrunched newspaper in the bottom of the starter. You only need to ball the paper up loosely, as having it too tight can prevent the flame from getting enough oxygen. The paper will act like a rapid, large match for your charcoal, starting the fire. If your chimney doesn't have a solid bottom, place the paper on the charcoal grate of your grill and lower the chimney on top of it.\n3. Fill the top of the chimney with charcoal briquets or wood chips. Fill the entire chimney up with your favorite charcoal, or a mixture of both. Use enough charcoal for your entire grill, as the chimney will ensure that everything is evenly lit. For a normal, 22\" grill this means roughly 40 briquets, but simply filling your chimney to the top should be a close enough estimate.\n4. Light the paper from the bottom in 2-3 places. Use long matches or a grill lighter to protect your hands. The paper will burn up quickly, but the concentrated flames and hot air will ignite the bottom charcoal, which will then light the rest of the chimney. Place your chimney on the charcoal grate of the grill or a heat-resistant surface as it heats up. It will get very hot, and can cause a fire if left unattended.\n5. Dump the coals on the grill the top pieces are covered in gray\/white ash. As the heat rises in the chimney, the coals on top will catch and start to coat with white\/gray ash. It usually takes 10-15 minutes to get hot enough. You are then ready to start grilling. Dump the coals in the center of the grill if you plan on keeping the whole grill surface hot, or on one-half of the grill if you want separate areas for direct and indirect cooking. If you plan to grill for more than a half hour then add several handfuls of charcoal now so that they catch as they others begin to fade..\n6. Make sure the vents are open for a larger fire. Open vents send more air and oxygen to the fire, helping it grow quickly. Keep the lid open as you position the coals and sear anything your want to grill, then close it to smoke the meat or cook it more slowly.\n\n\n## Use lighter fluid\n\n1. Open the bottom vents of your grill and remove the cooking grate. Get rid of the cooking grate, set the top aside, and open the bottom vents of the grill. You want as much air as possible to get to your charcoal in order to start an even, strong burning fire. Clean out any ash now, as it will smother your fire and keep the charcoal from lighting evenly.\n2. Form a \"pyramid\" of charcoal briquettes, with the peak in the center of the grill. Aim the opening of the bag into the center of the grill when dumping out the briquettes to naturally form a pyramid. Then use your hands or a pair of long-handled tongs to stack any other pieces of charcoal along the sides on the pyramid. Start with roughly half the number of briquettes outlined below to start your grill. Once it's hot, add charcoal, 5-7 piece at a time, to get the grill up to full strength. For a small, portable grill, you want 25-30 briquettes, or pieces of charcoal, when you start cooking. For a medium to average sized grill, you'll want roughly 40 briquettes. For a large or industrial grill, you will need 1 bag or more of charcoal to cook.\n3. Squirt a small amount of lighter fluid in the center of your pyramid. You don't want to drench your charcoal in the fluid, as it takes a while to burn and will make a thick, unappetizing smoke. Simply squirt the fluid for no more than a count of \"2 Mississippi\" around the center of the pyramid, trying to get the fluid in the middle. You can also start your pyramid, douse the inner briquets with fluid, then pile the \"top\" of the pyramid above the lighter fluid soaked briquets to make sure the whole pile gets hot. A mistake that many grillers make is using too much lighter fluid, which then imparts a petroleum-like tinge to the taste of their food. You do not need a lot of fluid, just enough to get a few pieces of charcoal smoking. These pieces will then help the rest of the pile catch.\n4. Let the briquettes with lighter fluid soak for 2-3 minutes. Do not light the grill immediately. Waiting allows the lighter fluid to soak into the top layer of charcoal, helping it to burn evenly.\n5. Apply a thin second layer of lighter fluid. Lightly squirt the pyramid with a few bursts of lighter fluid in several places, only letting it soak in for a few seconds. This is what will \"catch,\" so you don't want to drown the charcoal in fluid or you risk a dangerous flair up. You just want a few little areas of fluid to start your fire.\n6. Light the fire safely with a long match or electric lighter. Though lighter fluid is not made to flare up, it should still be treated with respect. Light the pile in 2-3 places where you put the lighter fluid, aiming to get the middle of the pile lit where possible. The fire will likely start large, with big flames leaping around the charcoals, but this is just the lighter fluid burning. Once the flames die down, the center of the pile should be smoking and developing white\/gray coloring. This means your fire has caught.\n7. Spread the briquettes out once they are mostly covered in gray\/white ash. Once you can barely see any black, the fire is ready for cooking. The inner coals of your pyramid should be glowing red. Spread the coals in your desired pattern, adding more if you plan on grilling for a long time. As a general rule of thumb, you should add a handful or two of coals every 30 minutes if you plan on continuing to grill. You want 1-2 layers of charcoal over your entire grilling area, not patches of charcoal or solitary, exposed coals. Charcoal maintains heat by staying clustered together, much like ice in a pack stays cold longer than separated cubes. If you've added charcoal, wait 5-6 minutes for them to catch. Since the heat of the rest of the charcoals is already hot enough, it should not take long.\n8. Seal up any unused briquets for next time. Use a clip to seal the top of the bag if you have leftovers in the bag. The additives in the charcoal will evaporate, making them harder to light next time with or without lighter fluid.\n\n\n## Build and keep a strong fire\n\n1. Pack your charcoals together for strong, direct heat. As you cook, use your tongs to keep the charcoals together, as solitary briquettes will quickly lose heat and do little to keep your fire going. You do not want them so well packed that they can't get air, but you also don't want them separated like many little islands.There are two styles of charcoal placement, depending on how you plan to cook:\n\t* \n\t* Even Grilling: Coat the entire bottom surface of the grill with two layers of charcoal. This allows the whole grill to reach a consistent, even temperature. If you're cooking food quickly and don't need any indirect heat (for large, slow-cooking cuts of meat), this is the way to go. Two-Zone Grilling: Shuffle all of the charcoals into an even pile on half of the grill, leaving the other half bare. This lets you cook foods quickly, directly over the charcoals, but also allows you to cook slower cuts by indirect heat on the opposite side of the grill. You can also keep already cooked food warm, on the empty side of the grill, or smoke them with grill top on.\n2. Add coals regularly to keep your grill burning hot. Don't wait until you're almost out of briquets to add more. Instead, add 5-10 pieces of charcoal when you have roughly half of your charcoals remaining, usually every 30 minutes. Wait 5-10 minutes while the new charcoal ignites and begins to get a white\/gray coat on the outside before you resume cooking. If you feel like you need more coals, add them. More coals mean a hotter burning grill. Add slowly, putting on 5-6 at a time, until your grill reaches your desired heat.\n3. Keep the top and bottom vents open to get the hottest temperature. The more air you get to the fire, the hotter it will cook, so opening the vents is key to a hot, strong burning charcoal fire. The more oxygen you give to the flames. the hotter your grill will be. If you need to control the temperature, close one or both of the vents partially. Closing both of them at once can suffocate your fire and extinguish it. Closing the upper vent is also useful for smoking, as it lowers the temperature of the fire and traps the smoke in the grill around your food.\n4. Empty the ash frequently. There is a small lever that lets you open and close the bottom vents on your grill, and this same lever can be used to remove ash through the vents. Ash takes up space for air and will smother the coals as it builds up.\n5. Adding hardwood charcoal for added flavor and greater heat. Wood burns hotter than briquettes, leading to a smokier flavor and an easier sear. It also burns faster than briquettes, however, leading many cooks to use a combination of the two. This allows you to keep the fire burning for longer but still get a hot, smokey fire going to sear steaks or larger cuts or meat. Try hickory or applewood charcoal for the best, classic BBQ flavor and a strong fire.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to handle feeling out of place at work?","response":"Many people spend a large percentage of their lives at work. This can feel terrible if you are one of many people who feel detached and disengaged within the culture of their workplace. Workplace loneliness can impact your performance and engagement, so overcoming the feeling of not belonging is central to your success. Knowing how to connect with people at work is also an important professional skill that can help your career. Manage the feeling of being out of place at work by trying to figure out what caused it, making an effort to interact, and finding solutions for disengagement.\n\n## Address the feel\n\n1. Try to label what you're feeling. Ask yourself what is keeping you from belonging. Co-workers sometimes hang out with their own age group by default and maybe you're much older or younger. Perhaps you are a manager and feel excluded from your subordinates?Maybe everyone else has energy for the job, but you're dealing with burnout. There even may be varying levels of lifestyles, values, or interests separating you and your colleagues. Sit down with paper and a pen and try to list whatever reasons come to mind. After you make a tentative list, you can spend a few days observing yourself and your peers at work to see if your reasons are accurate.\n2. Change your internal dialogue. Sometimes, the biggest roadblock keeping you from connecting with people is in your own head. If you keep telling yourself you don't fit in, you won't. Your thought patterns can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which what you believe about yourself becomes true. If you're thinking you don't belong, you're awkward, or people won't like you, reframe your self-talk. Create a list of positive, realistic statements about your workplace connections, such as \u201cI have much to offer as a friend\u201d or \u201cI enjoy the culture of my workplace, so I am certain to find people with common interests.\u201d\n3. Consider any constructive criticism you have received. If your boss or a peer has recently expressed concern that you are not a team player, dominate conversations, or bring a toxic competitive vibe to the workplace, you may need to dial it back to feel like a part of the group. If you shrugged off their feedback without trying to make positive change, they may be excluding you on purpose. If this describes your circumstances, you have two options: you can stay the way you are and remain excluded or reflect on their feedback and find ways to improve. It's up to you, just know that if you choose to stay the same, you could be hurting your reputation and growth within your career.\n4. Get help. Your engagement at your job has a major influence on your career growth and life satisfaction. If you can't seem to identify what's keeping you from fitting in, you made need to seek out professional assistance. If you are struggling with self-esteem issues or social anxiety, you should see a mental health expert. If you are dissatisfied with your choice of work or feel like your workplace does not align with your values, it may help to see a career counselor. Look into leadership or self-help workshops to get help with specific areas of personal development. One good option for leadership and self-improvement training is called Landmark Education.\n\n\n## Attempt to interact\n\n1. Set a daily conversation quota. Not belonging doesn't feel good, so even if you don't make any major changes, it can still make you feel better to interact more often. Make a personal goal to have one or two conversations with a peer at work each day. Think of some conversation starters to make it easier. Increase your chances of conversing by hanging out with your co-workers more. If they eat in the break room, don't take your lunch at your desk or work-station. Join them. Then, listen to their discussion and participate when you have something of value to add. For example, your co-workers are discussing vacation plans and one of them mentions a trip to a specific location. If you have an interest in that place, you might say, \u201cThat sounds so exciting! What sorts of excursions are you planning during your visit?\u201d\n2. Focus on the other person, not on your own shyness. If you are shy or hesitant about chatting it up with your co-workers, follow this rule-of-thumb: don't dwell on how shy you feel, turn your attention completely to the other person. Act as if you are serving them in a way\u2014try to make them smile or laugh, get them talking about their own life. When you're worried about how you're coming off to others, you might over-analyze and end up ruining a perfectly decent interaction. Take a break from focusing on yourself and devote your attention to the other speaker. Make sure to ask open-ended questions to keep the other person talking. These are questions that invite elaboration and that don't have a simple yes or no answer. Be willing to share about yourself as well to keep the conversation going and to form a genuine connection.\n3. Don't turn down invitations. If you're notorious for responding with \u201cno\u201d each time your peers invite you to lunch or to after-work drinks, they'll quickly stop asking. No one wants to be rejected over and over again, so you may have inadvertently caused them to exclude you. When you catch them discussing plans, ask if you can tag along. Or, if someone directly invites you, try to say \u201cyes\u201d unless you absolutely cannot go. Practicing saying yes to invites can improve your work life and your personal life. Accept a set amount of invitations per week and invite people to do things as well.\n4. Ask a co-worker out for coffee or similar. If the group as a whole makes you self-conscious, target one particularly non-intimidating, friendly co-worker. Making just one social connection at work can help you feel less isolated. Plus, once this person gets to know you, they might encourage the others to do the same. Say something like, \u201cHey, Carla, I enjoyed our talk earlier. It's refreshing to talk to another newbie mom. Would you like to get coffee together one morning before work?\u201d\n5. Suggest to your boss the idea of workplace socials. If your workplace culture doesn't emphasize inclusion, you might not be the only one feeling left out. Make a recommendation to your superior to stimulate connectedness with group events. Plan a potluck lunch or dinner to celebrate a company victory. Start a baseball, cricket, soccer, netball or basketball team.\n6. Seek advice about purposeful exclusion. Maybe your co-workers seem to have a vendetta against you, overlooking you for social outings and never including you in workplace gift exchanges. If this is the case, you will have to carefully consider how you choose to move forward. The best thing to do is to talk with someone you trust at your workplace about what has been happening. It can also help to first share your worries with a trusted friend. You might say, \"I get the sense that I am the odd one out at work. They never include me. And they stop talking whenever I come around. What should I do?\" Even if you don't take your friend's advice, it can help to have some unbiased support.\n\n\n## Deal with disengagement\n\n1. Resist acting out to get attention. Studies show that when an employee feels excluded, they may engage in acting out behaviors to get noticed. Examples might include cutting co-workers out of projects, cheating, lying, or aggressively competing. If you are tempted to behave this way, think about the possible repercussions first. Acting out will only make you feel more excluded, and it could jeopardize your job too.\n2. Set an objective workplace goal. Chances are you could be disengaged from work because you no longer feel challenged. Simply because your job description doesn't entail any lofty accomplishments or goals doesn't mean you can't strive for them. Create your own personal goals to work towards. This could be just what you need to feel passionate about your work and reconnect with the group. For example, you might aim to get so many reports done by 5pm each day. Or, you might develop a track to move towards a promotion or transfer to a new company. Try to focus on what you can control and avoid trying to control things that are outside of your control.\n3. Reevaluate the job. If the work you do and the people you do it with leave you feeling lackluster, you could be in the wrong career. If you have to change the way you act, undermine your values, or fantasize about leaving your job each day, pay attention to these cues. The culture of your workplace is just as important to your satisfaction as the actual position and salary. It may be time to quit. Re-examine why you got onto this career path or took this job.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to love your body?","response":"## Develop the right mind set\n\n1. Do not compare yourself to others. Our standards for beauty are majorly influenced by media, Hollywood, and popular culture. Through these outlets, we develop negative judgements of our bodies by comparing ourselves to photoshopped pictures and glamorized movie stars. These images are created and altered by computers and are not realistic goals to achieve. Popular media can be hard to ignore, but you can loosen the grip of majority rule by deciding to love your body because your body is real. Whenever you see an image in a magazine, commercial ad, or some other media outlet, remind yourself that the image is false. The person you are looking at has most likely been air brushed and altered to look like that. You should not compare yourself to computerized images.\n2. Give yourself compliments. Having love in your life starts with loving yourself. You should view and treat yourself with the same kindness and admiration you would with someone you love. You probably wouldn't critique another person's body for the same things you critique on yourself. Don't hesitate to give yourself a compliment, go easy on your mistakes, and forgive yourself when you mess up. Drop the self-hatred, and replace it with understanding and appreciation. Look in the mirror and say \"I am attractive, confident, and amazing!\" Keep that up and eventually you will see yourself in a more positive light. When you accomplish a goal, let yourself know how proud you are of yourself. Look into a mirror and say, \"Great job, I am so proud of you.\"\n3. Practice gratitude. Appreciate what you have and love your inner-self. Do not let the number on the scale or your pant size define who you are or of what you are capable. Nothing good will come from being mean to yourself when you look in the mirror. Here are some ways to practice gratitude in your everyday life:\n\t* When a bad situation presents itself, do not let it get you down. Instead, ask yourself what you can learn from it when you look back on it and what you may be grateful for. Make a vow not to be negative or criticize for ten days. If you slip up, forgive yourself and keep going. You will notice how much energy you were wasting on negative thoughts. Keep a gratitude journal to write down the things you are grateful for everyday. Your body is a miracle, and you should celebrate all of the gifts your body has given you. Think about all of your great accomplishments, relationships, and activities you love that your body has allowed you to have and record them everyday.\n4. Make a list of all of the positive things in your life. Everyone has insecurities, but the key is focusing on what you like about yourself and your life. It can be easy to let the negatives outweigh the positives, but making a list can help prevent this. Start off by finding one thing that you like about yourself, no matter how small. Once you are feeling more confident in that thing, identify a second thing and so on. Build up a list of things you love about yourself, and when you hear a negative thought pop into your head, immediately refocus on the list. Eventually, you will see more positive qualities than negative.\n5. Steer clear of negativity. Stay away from people who often rant about their bodies. Their insecurities can rub off onto you and get you thinking about what problems you may have. Life is too precious to waste time self-loathing or knit-picking about your body, especially when your own self perceptions are usually more critical than what anyone else thinks. If someone starts to bash or criticize their own body or life, do not engage in the negativity. Instead, change the subject or make your exit.\n6. Exude confidence. When you act like you have confidence, you will feel good about yourself. Even if you don't feel like you have any, pretend. Pull back your shoulders, tilt your head up, and smile. Smiling is one of the biggest things you can do to improve both your self-image and the way others see you. If you hold yourself confidently, inner confidence will follow.\n\n\n## Practice healthy habit\n\n1. Practice healthy hygiene. To feel good about yourself, and show respect to your body, start every day with a refreshing shower. Use nice smelling soap, wash your face, and put deodorant on after you shower. This will keep you refreshed, confident around people, and help send positive thoughts to your mind.\n2. Wear comfortable clothes that help you feel good. Everything in your closet should complement your current body shape and appeal to you. Don't wear something uncomfortable just to impress others if it makes you feel self-conscious. Remember, you always look better being yourself. Wear clean clothes free of tears or rips to dress your body the way it deserves. Buy matching underwear and bras even if you are the only one who will see them. This tells your inner-self that you are doing this for you and only you.\n3. Commit to daily affirmations. Affirmations are positive statements that are meant to be repeated until the mind starts to believe them as true. Verbalizing what you like about yourself helps your brain to remember more easily than just thinking thoughts silently. You can personalize your daily affirmations however you see fit, just make sure they are positive statements. Here is a great statement to start with:\n\t* Everyday, look into a mirror, and say, \"I am beautiful; I am loved; I love myself as I am.\"\n4. Eat a well-balanced diet. Make a goal to eat fruits and vegetables each day to nourish your body and thank it for all that it gives you. This will not only give you a glow and long-lasting health benefits, but it will teach you how to respect your body. This does not mean that you have to stick to a strict dietary plan, but do make an effort to eliminate junk food and eat healthier to fuel your body.\n5. Get regular exercise. The best way to love your body is to partake in physical activities that are good for you and help you feel good. Don't just exercise to lose weight, but do it to take care of your heart and overall health. For example, yoga is good for relaxation, core strength and general well being, whereas sports are an excellent way to release energy productively and has been shown to improve mood.\n\n\n## Find support\n\n1. Ask others what they love about you. Although it may be scary and intimidating, ask your friends and loved ones what they think your best qualities are. This will help boost your confidence and remind you that your body has given you so many gifts. You will most likely be surprised at the wonderful things they see in you that you often miss. Here is a way you can ask:\n\t* Start off by giving your friend or loved one a great compliment, and then ask, \"What do you think is my best quality?\"\n2. Surround yourself with people who love themselves. People develop the attitude and behaviors of the people who surround them. If you keep positive influences in your life, you will adopt those attitudes which will help you love yourself, inside and out. Look for people who are optimistic, work hard toward their goals, and respect themselves.\n3. Follow after your role models. Think about all of the people either directly in your life, or those who have accomplished amazing things that you admire. Those individuals are most likely renowned and respected for their accomplishments outside of their bodies. Use this to help you remember that your body does not stand in the way of your life or happiness. Your body can help you pursue all of your dreams and desires. Think about your family members, close friends, or someone you have never met but always admired, and make a list of their best qualities. Then, ask yourself if their self-image or body made the list, or kept them from achieving their accomplishments.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to service an air conditioner?","response":"Whether you're starting your air conditioner for the first time this year, or a unit isn't running properly and you need to service an air conditioner, following a few simple steps can save you time and money. While some service jobs should be left to a professional, there are several do-it-yourself fixes you can do to keep your air conditioner cooling all summer long.\n\n## Clean the air conditioner\n\n1. Make sure the unit is turned off either at the on\/off switch and unplugging it or by shutting off the circuit breaker. Servicing the a\/c while it's connected to power may result in electrocution.\n2. Check the small copper pipe connecting the unit to the house. If it feels hot, the unit's coils are most likely dirty and need to be washed.\n3. Rake any leaves and debris away from the unit before you start to service an air conditioner.\n4. Take the cover off the unit, and locate the air conditioner coils (they look like a car radiator).\n5. Use a soft brush to brush any dirt and debris off the outside cover.\n6. Cover the motor and wiring with a plastic sheet.\n7. Hose down the fins, coils and inside of the unit.\n8. Check your owner's manual. Some air conditioner units require the motor be lubricated. Do this now while your unit is open.\n9. Replace the unit cover, and turn it on to make sure it runs properly. The air conditioner filter should also be replaced every few months. It is usually located near the return air duct by the furnace.\n\n\n## Check air conditioner function\n\n1. Start at the unit control or thermostat. Turn the unit on and make sure it kicks in and runs properly. If the unit doesn't run, call a technician.\n2. Listen for any strange noises while the unit runs. If you hear any squealing or knocking the unit's motor and belts may need lubricating or replacing. It's best to call a certified technician to do these jobs.\n3. Check the room temperature in each of the home's rooms by carrying a hand held thermometer into the room. Leave the thermometer in the room for a few minutes to give it time to adjust and make sure all the rooms are equal in temperature.\n4. Make sure the temperature of the rooms agrees with the thermostat on your air conditioner unit as well. If they are not the same, a technician can help you diagnose and correct the problem.\n5. Look for water dripping or pooling anywhere by the air return or unit outside.\n\n\n## Fix pool water issue\n\n1. Check for leaks in the tubing where the water is pooling. If there are any cracks, holes or leaks the tube should be replaced.\n2. Find the drain where the water condensation should be draining into. There should be a floor drain near the condensation pipe located by the furnace\/air conditioner central unit.\n3. Clean the drain of any debris if the water seems to be pooling on top of it.\n4. Pour water into the condensation drain pan and watch for the condensation pump to start working. The pump should activate and pump the water out and to the drain. If the pump doesn't remove the water, the drain pan is probably overfilling and the pump will need to be replaced by a technician.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You might be starting your air conditioner for the first time this year.","max_prob":15.3953561783,"ccp":-0.7071185627},{"claim":"A unit might not be running properly.","max_prob":19.8242797852,"ccp":-0.0026142955},{"claim":"You might need to service an air conditioner.","max_prob":7.5223665237,"ccp":-0.6160041977},{"claim":"Following a few simple steps can save you time.","max_prob":12.7285022736,"ccp":-0.9338290489},{"claim":"Following a few simple steps can save you money.","max_prob":12.1602115631,"ccp":-0.8884930825},{"claim":"Some service jobs should be left to a professional.","max_prob":13.8030834198,"ccp":-0.3519405774},{"claim":"There are several do-it-yourself fixes you can do.","max_prob":15.5580358505,"ccp":-0.9055019801},{"claim":"You can do these fixes to keep your air conditioner cooling.","max_prob":22.0338058472,"ccp":-0.9330007154},{"claim":"These fixes can keep your air conditioner cooling all summer long.","max_prob":16.7337818146,"ccp":-0.2773681247},{"claim":"The unit can be turned off at the on\/off switch.","max_prob":12.7659730911,"ccp":-0.067736624},{"claim":"The unit can be turned off by unplugging it.","max_prob":12.071644783,"ccp":-0.6897486843},{"claim":"The unit can be turned off by shutting off the circuit breaker.","max_prob":7.3071942329,"ccp":-0.6271134334},{"claim":"The unit has a cover.","max_prob":3.7307143211,"ccp":-0.3759104222},{"claim":"The cover can be taken off the unit.","max_prob":7.1084384918,"ccp":-0.2337513458},{"claim":"The unit contains air conditioner coils.","max_prob":6.5947475433,"ccp":-0.0492158218},{"claim":"The air conditioner coils look like a car radiator.","max_prob":14.4975414276,"ccp":-0.006041459},{"claim":"Hose down the fins.","max_prob":9.7013683319,"ccp":-0.0029722555},{"claim":"Hose down the coils.","max_prob":8.9810686111,"ccp":-0.008775463},{"claim":"Hose down the inside of the unit.","max_prob":11.7695598602,"ccp":-0.0062143268},{"claim":"The unit cover should be replaced.","max_prob":5.1619510651,"ccp":-0.227060544},{"claim":"The unit should be turned on.","max_prob":3.9483933449,"ccp":-0.5469831609},{"claim":"The unit should run properly.","max_prob":6.7948622704,"ccp":-0.808973281},{"claim":"The air conditioner has a filter.","max_prob":8.0434074402,"ccp":-0.1587836963},{"claim":"The filter of the air conditioner should be replaced.","max_prob":10.0235261917,"ccp":-0.0804539901},{"claim":"The replacement of the air conditioner filter should occur every few months.","max_prob":14.234919548,"ccp":-0.0700444812},{"claim":"There is a home with multiple rooms.","max_prob":13.8351964951,"ccp":-0.1532816785},{"claim":"Each room in the home has a room temperature.","max_prob":13.8351964951,"ccp":-0.1532816785},{"claim":"A hand-held thermometer can be used to check the room temperature.","max_prob":26.2512168884,"ccp":-0.0015641125},{"claim":"The action involves carrying the thermometer into each room.","max_prob":21.2586021423,"ccp":-0.0115613895},{"claim":"There should be a floor drain near the condensation pipe.","max_prob":20.2142028809,"ccp":-0.0015819927},{"claim":"The condensation pipe is located by the furnace\/air conditioner central unit.","max_prob":35.9086875916,"ccp":-0.0906626038},{"claim":"Water is poured into the condensation drain pan.","max_prob":18.6056003571,"ccp":-0.0001736532},{"claim":"The condensation pump starts working.","max_prob":14.9894924164,"ccp":-0.0396797011},{"claim":"The pump doesn't remove the water.","max_prob":12.0989360809,"ccp":-0.3003582631},{"claim":"The drain pan is probably overfilling.","max_prob":19.5565280914,"ccp":-0.031871922},{"claim":"The pump will need to be replaced by a technician.","max_prob":10.8494310379,"ccp":-0.4204012971}]}
{"instruction":"How to eat to slow down bone loss in menopause?","response":"Your bones reach their peak bone mass level when you are in your 30s, and then bone mass starts to decline. For women approaching menopause, bone loss is an even bigger concern because bone cell regeneration begins to slow around this time. However, there are steps that you can take to prevent bone loss, including avoiding certain foods, eating calcium-rich foods, and taking other preventative measures like exercising and having a bone mineral density test. Learn how to eat to get the right blend of vitamins and minerals and reduce your chances of losing bone mass as you age.\n\n## Reduce bone loss with food choices\n\n1. Steer clear of soft drinks. Many carbonated beverages contain phosphoric acid, which can affect your body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium. Phosphoric acid causes you to lose calcium when you urinate. To reduce the calcium that you lose from drinking sodas, limit or avoid sodas altogether. Try drinking beverages that do not contain phosphoric acid, such as club soda, water, herbal teas, black or green teas, or fortified orange juice.\n2. Watch your sodium intake. Sodium is a major cause of calcium loss and a high-sodium diet has been linked with developing osteoporosis. The more sodium you have in your diet, the more calcium you will need to get in order to make up for it. Try to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day to help reduce your calcium loss.\n3. Limit caffeine. Caffeine also reduces your body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium, so it is important to keep your caffeine intake under control to prevent low calcium levels. If you want to eliminate bone loss from caffeine intake, you can switch to decaf or choose beverages that are naturally caffeine free, such as peppermint or chamomile tea. Try not to exceed 300 milligrams of caffeine per day. That\u2019s about the equivalent of 2 8 fl oz (240 mL) cups of coffee. Try switching to tea. It is lower in caffeine than coffee and has been shown to protect bones from calcium loss.\n4. Cook from scratch whenever possible. Food that is processed lacks trace minerals that have a protective effect on bones. To make sure that you are getting the most nutrient-dense diet possible, cook your meals from scratch whenever you can. Try choosing fresh instead of frozen or canned vegetables, make your own bread, cook whole grains such as brown rice, and avoid pre-packaged prepared foods.\n5. Choose quality proteins. Since bones are made up of mostly protein, getting enough of the right kind of protein is an important part of maintaining bone density. Try to avoid red meat as much as possible since it tends to be more acidic and may reduce the amount of calcium that your body can absorb. Make sure that you include enough quality protein sources for your size and gender to reduce bone loss. Good sources of protein include:\n\t* Eggs\n\t* Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt\n\t* Poultry, such as chicken and turkey\n\t* Seafood, such as salmon, halibut, and shrimp\n6. Skip the soy unless your doctor recommends it. Soy has been found to have adverse effects on the absorption of calcium as well, so it is best to avoid eating too much soy. Even if a soy product is fortified with calcium, your body won\u2019t absorb the calcium well. If you rely on soy as a primary source of protein, then it is a good idea to take a calcium supplement for extra protection. On the other hand, some studies have shown that eating soy-based foods may improve bone health overall and reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about whether you should incorporate soy into your diet.\n7. Eat sources of Vitamin K. There are 2 forms of vitamin K: K1(phylloquinone) and K2 (menaquinone). The combination is sometimes called MK7 in commercial supplement products. You should aim for about 250-1000 mcg of K1 and 45-180 mcg of K2 per day. Eat a good source of vitamin K 2 to 3 times a week to get these amounts or take a supplement. Natural food sources of vitamin K include:\n\t* Sauerkraut\n\t* Aged cheese\n\t* Natto (a soy product)\n\t* Kimchee (fermented Korean cabbage)\n\t* Beef liver\n\t* Green tea\n\t* Turnip greens\n\t* Broccoli\n\t* Kale\n\t* Spinach\n\t* Cabbage\n\t* Asparagus\n\t* Dark green lettuce\n\n\n## Get more calcium\n\n1. Drink and eat low-fat dairy products. Dairy products provide a significant amount of calcium, so make sure that you include 2 to 3 servings of dairy per day in order to get enough calcium. Since dairy products are naturally high in fat, it is a good idea to seek out low-fat and fat free dairy products. Milk has long been known as a good source of calcium and it should be a staple in your diet if you are trying to avoid bone loss. Drink 2 to 3 glasses of low-fat or non-fat milk per day. Cheese and yogurt are also good sources calcium, although they do not contain as much calcium as milk does. Choose low-fat cheese and yogurt to reduce your intake of unhealthy fats.\n2. Include canned sardines and salmon in your diet. Certain canned fish, such as sardines and salmon, are also good sources of calcium, as long as you eat the bones. The fish bones tend to be softer in canned fish, so they are edible. When eaten fresh, certain types of fish are good sources of vitamin D as well. For example, salmon, tuna, and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D.\n3. Have some leafy greens. Leafy greens such as kale, Chinese cabbage, turnip greens, and collard greens are also good sources of calcium. Try saut\u00e9ing some greens, adding them to a soup, or using them in place of your usual salad greens.\n4. Choose calcium-fortified orange juice. Drinking orange juice that has been fortified with calcium may also help you to prevent bone loss. Choose fortified orange juice as well as other types of fortified beverages to get a little more calcium in your diet.\n5. Take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet every day, take a supplement that contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. To help prevent bone loss, it is crucial to get enough magnesium and vitamin D along with calcium. It may be easier for your body to absorb calcium if you take it in smaller doses with meals (500 mg at a time). However, it is possible to get too much calcium, so talk to your doctor about the best amount and type of calcium supplement for you.\n\n\n## Take other step\n\n1. Get regular exercise. Performing regular weight-bearing exercise is a good way to build bone mass and prevent bone loss as well. Weight-bearing exercises include walking, dancing, jogging, and dancing. Non-weight bearing exercises include biking and swimming. Try going for a 30-minute walk most days of the week to get in some weigh-bearing exercise and help prevent bone loss.\n2. Spend time in the sun. The best way to get your daily dose of vitamin D is to spend about 15\u201320 minutes in the sun without sunblock every day. Exposure to the sun allows your body to produce its own vitamin D. Since this may not always be possible, especially during the winter in some places, supplementing with vitamin D is still advised.\n3. Get tested for osteoporosis. One serious problem with osteoporosis is that it can be symptomless. Many women will not know that they have osteoporosis until after a bone fracture. That is why it is a good idea to have a bone mineral density (BMD) test if you are at risk of osteoporosis. This test is often called a DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and can help your healthcare professional to diagnose osteoporosis. Women over the age of 65 are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis, but other women under the age of 65 may be affected as well. Ask your doctor about getting a DEXA scan if you have:\n\t* Broken a bone from doing something that should not have caused a broken bone, like falling from a standing position\n\t* A chronic condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, or an eating disorder\n\t* Early onset menopause\n\t* Undergone hormone treatments, such as for prostate or breast cancer\n\t* Lost a noticeable amount of height\n\t* A history of smoking or currently smoke\n\t* Family members who have had osteoporosis\n\t* Been taking certain medications, such as corticosteroid or thyroid hormone replacement medications\n\t* A tendency to drink 3 or more alcoholic beverages most days\n4. Learn your T-score and Z-score. The results of a DEXA scan are known as a \u201cT-score\u201d and a \u201cZ-score,\u201d though for most people, the T-score is most important. In both the T-scores and the Z-scores, a negative number indicates that your bones are thinner or more porous than they should be. A higher negative number means that you have a higher risk of a bone fracture. If your T-score is between 0 and -1.0, this is considered normal. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 indicates that you have early osteoporosis, known as osteopenia. A T-score of less than -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.\n\n\n## When to seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor if you have symptoms of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis doesn\u2019t always have symptoms, especially in its early stages. However, there are some signs and symptoms you can look out for if you\u2019re going through menopause or have other risk factors for osteoporosis. Call your doctor right away if:You\u2019ve recently fractured a bone, especially if the fracture happened more easily than expected\n\t* You are experiencing frequent back pain\n\t* You notice your posture becoming stooped\n\t* You\u2019re not as tall as you used to be\n2. Ask your doctor about medical treatment or prevention options. Diet and lifestyle changes can help prevent or slow bone loss associated with menopause, but there are also medical options. If you\u2019re going through menopause and are at risk of developing osteoporosis, your doctor may recommend taking hormone therapy, vitamin D supplements, or osteoporosis medications. Common osteoporosis medications include:Bisphosphonates, a type of medication that prevents bone loss\n\t* Injected medications that can prevent bone loss and even stimulate new bone growth, such as denosumab (Prolia) and teriparatide (Forteo)\n3. Talk to your doctor before making major diet or lifestyle changes. Your individual diet and exercise needs depend on a lot of factors, including your age, weight, and overall health. Before drastically changing your diet or starting a new exercise regimen, talk to your doctor about what\u2019s safe and healthy for you. For example, if you already have osteoporosis or a related condition, such as osteoarthritis, your doctor may advise avoiding certain types of exercise. Talk to them about doing forms of exercise that are easy on your bones and joints, such as low-impact aerobics, swimming, biking, or fast walking. Always let your doctor know before you take any dietary supplements, since these could interfere with medications or supplements you are already taking, or affect any medical conditions you might have.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to wear a cowboy hat properly?","response":"Cowboy hats have a long tradition, both for functional purposes while working and as a fashion statement. Even if it seems as simple as setting the hat on your head and going about your business, there are some rules to follow if you want to wear a cowboy hat properly. You need to get a hat that fits right, shape it a little bit, make sure the front is forward, and angle to give your look the proper attitude.\n\n## Choose your hat\n\n1. Get the right size. The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.\n2. Fix your current hat to fit better. You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back. Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat. There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.\n3. Pick the right hat. You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during hot days.\n4. Shape your hat. Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You don\u2019t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.\n\n\n## Put the hat on your head\n\n1. Adjust your hair. You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this won\u2019t apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Don\u2019t pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option.\n2. Put the bow to the back. One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front.\n3. Angle your brim accordingly. Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.\n4. Pick the right outfit. Your best and simplest bet to wear with a cowboy hat is a button up shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of cowboy boots. The shirt be a plain color or plaid. Flannel shirt work well too. You want basic, straight leg blue jeans with no extra pockets on the sides, no designs or extra buttons on the back pockets, no intentional bleaching or stain marks. Just classic blue jeans. If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. It\u2019s going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on. You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Cowboy hats have a long tradition for functional purposes while working.","max_prob":42.4357719421,"ccp":-0.0000016418},{"claim":"Cowboy hats have a long tradition as a fashion statement.","max_prob":26.2807121277,"ccp":-0.0000021649},{"claim":"Setting the hat on your head and going about your business seems simple.","max_prob":18.4189815521,"ccp":-0.4568728362},{"claim":"There are some rules to follow to wear a cowboy hat properly.","max_prob":10.2284145355,"ccp":-0.7577252344},{"claim":"You need to get a hat that fits right.","max_prob":14.7276306152,"ccp":-0.1462434107},{"claim":"You need to shape the hat a little bit.","max_prob":16.877040863,"ccp":-0.1318265291},{"claim":"You need to make sure the front of the hat is forward.","max_prob":16.9504108429,"ccp":-0.6559440474},{"claim":"You need to angle the hat to give your look the proper attitude.","max_prob":31.2646980286,"ccp":-0.2017981243},{"claim":"You can buy foam strip.","max_prob":18.3257865906,"ccp":-0.0150474615},{"claim":"Foam strip is specifically made to put into hats.","max_prob":25.7900886536,"ccp":-0.0037503694},{"claim":"Foam strip is used to make hats fit tighter.","max_prob":26.7666873932,"ccp":-0.0035426641},{"claim":"You can put a little foam in the front and back of your head.","max_prob":15.3494586945,"ccp":-0.1572671778},{"claim":"You can put foam just on the sides of your head.","max_prob":16.4041233063,"ccp":-0.3360199174},{"claim":"You can put foam just on the back of your head.","max_prob":13.7095756531,"ccp":-0.2211991727},{"claim":"There is a band around the inside of the hat.","max_prob":8.608168602,"ccp":-0.0568750626},{"claim":"You can flip up the band.","max_prob":13.646150589,"ccp":-0.0438211946},{"claim":"You can place the foam strip under the band.","max_prob":13.9851779938,"ccp":-0.0443068953},{"claim":"The main material choices are felt, leather, and straw.","max_prob":17.8720550537,"ccp":-0.0108100921},{"claim":"Felt is made of beaver pelt.","max_prob":15.5582742691,"ccp":-0.0583264866},{"claim":"Felt is made of rabbit pelt.","max_prob":12.8378772736,"ccp":-0.3761101362},{"claim":"Felt hats are warmer.","max_prob":6.4897546768,"ccp":-0.9460309621},{"claim":"Felt hats tend to be worn more in the cold seasons.","max_prob":15.2091913223,"ccp":-0.9215556334},{"claim":"Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape.","max_prob":17.8960800171,"ccp":-0.891445573},{"claim":"Cowboy hats can be conformed by gently bending them.","max_prob":23.8316764832,"ccp":-0.3360277146},{"claim":"Cowboy hats can be conformed by gently squeezing them.","max_prob":26.0863342285,"ccp":-0.740604012},{"claim":"You can dent the sides of the crown of the hat.","max_prob":15.4970502853,"ccp":-0.0380284829},{"claim":"The denting can be done gently.","max_prob":11.1029167175,"ccp":-0.9284254707},{"claim":"Most cowboy hats have a small bow.","max_prob":5.3088755608,"ccp":-0.8405306121},{"claim":"The small bow is located on the inside lining.","max_prob":13.9094963074,"ccp":-0.5057448447},{"claim":"The small bow is around the headband.","max_prob":14.1105546951,"ccp":-0.5007888334},{"claim":"You want basic blue jeans.","max_prob":16.6535186768,"ccp":-0.2430024383},{"claim":"You want straight leg jeans.","max_prob":10.3276748657,"ccp":-0.2295349513},{"claim":"You want jeans with no extra pockets on the sides.","max_prob":19.8705711365,"ccp":-0.1684774911},{"claim":"You want jeans with no designs on the back pockets.","max_prob":16.1660442352,"ccp":-0.2282082866},{"claim":"You want jeans with no extra buttons on the back pockets.","max_prob":20.6888847351,"ccp":-0.1480150286},{"claim":"You want jeans with no intentional bleaching.","max_prob":25.0465278625,"ccp":-0.2444103714},{"claim":"You want jeans with no stain marks.","max_prob":16.1080303192,"ccp":-0.2739306495}]}
{"instruction":"How to wear long coats?","response":"A long coat is a nice item to have in any closet, especially for people living in colder climates. There is a variety of styles of long coats as well as ways you can wear them. Make your long coat work for you by finding a style that fits you, dressing it down for casual daily wear, or adding it on top of a dressy outfit for a formal occasion.\n\n## Choose the right coat\n\n1. Try a fit-and-flare coat for the illusion of a thinner waist. For a long coat that hides a thick waist, try a fit-and-flare style. These coats fit tighter around the waist and then flare out at the hips. The tops are often double-breasted, and there are strategically placed seams on them to create a thinner look. Solid black and vertical stripes also make people look thinner. Experiment with these colors if you\u2019re concerned about making your waist look thinner.\n2. Balance out wide hips with a voluminous collar on your coat. If you\u2019d like to create the illusion of smaller hips, choose a coat that has a large collar such as a shawl collar or large faux-fur collar. The volume of the collar will draw attention away from the bottom half of your coat.\n3. Add curves to a narrow frame with a belted coat. Belts add dimension to long, straight coats. Look for a long coat with a thick wrap-around belt if you\u2019d like to make your thin frame look curvier. Subtle pleats around the waist also help to add curves. Colors and patterns that add dimension for a thin person include light colors and plaid.\n4. Hide a rounder belly with a full-length men\u2019s coat. Most younger men today wear knee-length long coats, but that length looks best on trim men who can wear a more form-fitting coat. Full-length coats go past the knee to the mid-calf, and are nice for disguising a heavier figure. Full-length coats are also considerably warmer, so they are ideal for cold climates.\n5. Go with a double-breasted knee-length coat if you\u2019re petite. Long coats can easily swallow up a short person. A way to solve this is to keep the coat around knee-length or just past your knees. Double-breasted coats with a large envelope collar keep a proportioned look to a longer coat worn on a petite person. If you are of an average or taller height, you can easily pull off full-length coats that go past the knee to your mid-calf or below.\n6. Do the hug test to make sure the coat isn\u2019t too small. It\u2019s easy to buy a long coat that\u2019s too small because the length of the coat may make you think it fits you. To check, try the coat on and wrap your arms around yourself, trying to touch the opposite shoulder with each hand. If the coat feels really tight in the shoulders or elbows, you should go with the next size up. You can also check the sleeve length by holding your arms straight out in front of you. If the sleeves go up 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) past your wrists, you probably need the next size up. The sleeve end should fall within 1 in (2.5 cm) of you wrist when your arms are up, and go almost to your knuckles when they are down.\n7. Check that the shoulder seams line up with your shoulders. On a properly fitting coat, the shoulder seams should line up with your shoulders. If they go down near your biceps, the coat is either too big or it is supposed to have an oversized shape to it. Either try on the next size down, or confirm that oversized is the style that you\u2019re going for. Consider getting a coat tailored for you if cannot find a coat that fits correctly across your chest and shoulders as well as the length of your arms.\n8. Choose a wool coat for the longest winter wear. Long coats come in a variety of fabrics, but if you\u2019re planning to wear your coat for a long time during the winter, invest in 100% wool or a wool-cashmere blend. Coats made with all cashmere tend to show wear much faster. If you intend to wear your jacket in fall, spring, or summer weather, you have more options for fabric, including cotton and twill.\n\n\n## Wear a long coat casually\n\n1. Wear a black coat with ripped jeans and sneakers for a go-anywhere look. Long black coats are versatile because they can be casual or formal. Pair yours with ripped blue or black skinny jeans, a fitted graphic T-shirt, and your favorite sneakers. Plain white sneakers are a popular classic with this look, but you can experiment with vintage, black and white, or skate style sneakers to individualize the style.\n2. Pair baggy trousers with an oversized maxi coat and sunglasses for comfort. If you\u2019re looking to stay both comfortable and warm this winter, wear baggy black trousers rolled at the ankles with a cozy V-neck shirt under any color oversized maxi coat. Grey is a popular coat color for this look, but you can try navy or even a patterned coat. Sunglasses pull off the chic casual style of this look. Go with plain black glasses of any shape that you like. Try this look with either white sneakers or laced ankle boots.\n3. Wear a floor length coat with flared denim as an elegant-casual crossover. Floor-length coats take the classic long coat a few steps further; you can pull off a very cute, elegant casual look by pairing one with flared denim jeans. Wear this with an oversized knit sweater and dressy boots to complete the look. Add large sunglasses and a scarf to this look for extra flare.\n4. Try a long camel coat with a scarf for an intellectual touch. Long camel coats have an automatically sophisticated feel to them and are popular in the fall. Pair yours with black skinny jeans and a wide oversized scarf to look ready to hit the books. Complete this look with crisp white low-cut sneakers, a sweater, and pair of glasses.\n5. Add a beanie to any long coat for a fun casual look. Take the seriousness out of a long coat by adding a slouchy beanie on your head. Wear jeans or sweatpants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a pair of ankle boots or sneakers to finish off this casual style.\n6. Make an extra-long coat punk with colorful lace-up ankle boots. To achieve an 80s punk-inspired look, wear black skinny jeans and a button-down shirt with combat style boots under a mid-calf coat. To really finish off this look, add a few 1 inch (2.5 cm) band pins, or badges, to the lapels of your coat. Wear a pair of black sunglasses with this look to give it an extra rock-star vibe.\n7. Pair a pale maxi coat with cropped denim and a white T-shirt in the spring. Long coats aren\u2019t just for fall and winter; you can pair lighter long jackets with a variety of spring looks as well. Try a pale blue, pink, or white long coat with light blue cropped jeans or shorts. Add a colorful fitted T-shirt and sandals to complete the look. Instead of denim, wear a short spring sundress and casual sandals under your light long coat for cute but informal effect.\n\n\n## Dress up with a long coat\n\n1. Wear a long coat over black cigarette pants and heels for a sophisticated look. A long coat that\u2019s camel, grey, navy, red, or patterned looks great over top of black cigarette pants and heels. Wear a black blouse with this outfit, and try to match your heels with the coat for the best effect. For example, a camel coat with this outfit looks elegant with a pair of shiny nude heels.\n2. Try a long faux-fur coat with strappy heels for an elegant edge. No need to spend lots of money on real fur \u2013 there are many nice faux fur options out there for coats. Choose a black or white faux-fur coat and pair it with strappy heels, a short or mid-length skirt, or capris pants for an elegant look. Either chunky or stiletto heels work for this look; just make sure they are high and strappy.\n3. Pair leather leggings and heels with an extra-long black coat for serious glam. Find yourself a pair of black faux leather leggings and combine them with black heels of your choice for a glamourous look. Wear a simple white blouse underneath to finish off this look. Add a pair of classic large black sunglasses to this look for some extra glam.\n4. Wear a long unbuttoned coat over a cocktail dress for a night out. Go with a plain button-down black coat over a dark colored dress in the winter, or pair a lightweight camel trench coat over a light-colored or floral dress in the summer. Add heels to match your dress and jewelry to be ready for any formal occasion.\n5. Wear a Paletot or Guards\u2019 coat for versatility. The Paletot and Guards\u2019 coat styles are classic business coats for men that can be worn for any formal occasion. They are double-breasted with 2 rows of 6 buttons and peaked lapels. Navy blue or charcoal colors of this coat can be worn to a business meeting, over a tuxedo, or to a funeral.\n6. Pair a fitted long coat with dress trousers and loafers for any formal occasion. Dress trousers and shiny loafers, paired with a tucked button-down shirt, look sharp under any fitted long coat. Match your trousers to the coat and choose a dark colored shirt in the winter, or a lighter colored shirt in the summer. Add a tie that compliments your shirt to make this look extra formal.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to be a domestic goddess?","response":"Being a domestic goddess has distinct advantages, regardless of whether you live alone or serve as the matron of a big family. If you lack cleaning, cooking, and sewing skills, learning to master these tasks may seem intimidating. The key is to start small and avoid overwhelming yourself. With time and patience, you can polish your skills to goddess level.\n\n## Part one: chores and home maintenance\n\n1. Set a daily routine. There are a handful of chores you should do each day if you want to maintain a clean and clutter-free domestic heaven. Thankfully, these chores are quick enough to squeeze in even if you work a job outside of the home or have a houseful of kids to attend to. To reduce your stress as much as possible, plan on accomplishing each of these daily chores during a certain time of the day. Organizing your time may help you relieve some of the anxiety you feel about getting everything done. Daily tasks you'll need to make time for include making the bed, sorting the mail, and sweeping or vacuuming the floor. Other daily tasks should be performed as you go along. These include putting things away (to prevent clutter from developing), cleaning up as you cook, and wiping up fresh spills.\n2. Make a weekly schedule. Some chores only need to be done once or twice a week. Instead of rushing around to get these chores done all at once, plan on doing a little each day and set aside certain days for certain tasks. You'll likely feel more relaxed about getting things done, which means you'll do a better, more thorough job. Clean the bathrooms once a week. Make sure that you wash all bath linens and scrub all toilets, tubs, and sinks. Empty the trash, clean the mirrors, dust the lights, and wipe up the floor. The bedrooms in your home also need a thorough weekly cleaning. Put away anything that has been sitting out on a desk or side table. Clean all sheets, pillowcases, and blankets. Empty the trash, dust all the surfaces, and vacuum the floor. You may need to vacuum your living room, kitchen, and dining room every day or two, but other chores, like dusting, washing rugs\/mats, and wiping mirrors, can be done once a week.\n3. Experiment with different cleaning products. Not every household cleaner is just as good as every other. Moreover, different types of cleaners may work better on different areas of your home. If there is some part of your usual cleaning routine that leaves a lot to be desired, figure out why your current cleaner is not doing the job right and research which options might be better. Compare chemical and organic products. Nowadays, many people prefer cleaning products made from natural ingredients instead of chemical cleaners. Natural cleaners have their own pros and cons, just as chemical cleaners have, but it doesn't hurt to include a few organic products among those you plan on testing out. Ask your friends for suggestions or do some research online about your different options. Test a few different products out on a trial basis. Pay close attention to which products work best with different materials\u2014wood, glass, ceramic, plastic, and so on.\n4. Be handy. The modern domestic goddess needs to know a bit more about the handy side of home care than earlier counterparts did. You don't need to know how to maintain all the systems and utilities in your home, but learning how to take care of a few basic projects is a wise move. At minimum, your home tool kit should contain a hammer and a few different screwdrivers. These tools will allow you to do simple tasks like hanging pictures and making small repairs to things like toys, cabinets, and drawers.\n5. Organize your realm. Clutter is the natural enemy of any domestic goddess. If you want to maintain a living space that any mortal would be envious of, you need to keep things orderly and in their place. Brush up on space-saving techniques and similar skills to keep your belongings in check. This is especially important if you're dealing with limited space. Get rid of any unnecessary junk first, then organize everything that has a purpose in a way that makes sense based on your needs.\n6. Master the laundry. Laundry is one chore that you will never be able to avoid if you want to be a domestic goddess. Your current laundry skills might be adequate, but you should still continue to watch out for aspects of your laundry routine that could stand to use improvement. Consider assigning different laundry tasks to different days, as well. For instance, you can clean bathroom towels on Tuesday, bed sheets and pillowcases on Wednesday, and any other miscellaneous towels or blankets on Thursday. Clothing will need to be cleaned throughout the week, though. Read the labels before you wash something and follow the laundering instructions provided. If you aren't sure whether or not an item will bleed color in the washing machine, test it by soaking a small spot and blotting that spot with a white cloth. Wash colors and whites separately. Also separate heavily soiled items and wash those on their own. Pretreat stains and presoak heavily soiled garments in a sink or bucket of water for 30 minutes before washing them. Use the recommended amount of detergent and select the best washer cycle for each individual load. Base water temperature and dryer settings on color and fabric type. Materials that can shrink should be washed in warm or cold water and air dried, for instance. Cold water is best for bright colors, while hot water works well for whites.\n7. Learn a few tricks. Once you've mastered the basics, keep an eye out for various tips and tricks that can take your home skills from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201camazing.\u201d Some tricks work better than others, though, so you should test them out before bragging to your friends about your newfound knowledge. For instance, cover dirty stroller wheels and wagon wheels with plastic shower caps before bringing the item inside. Wrap pipe cleaners around the neck of condiment bottles to catch drips and prevent crusty build-up. Stuff holes in the wall and cabinets with steel wool to keep mice and other pests out.\n\n\n## Part two: in the kitchen\n\n1. Get off to an easy start. If you currently have some cooking and baking knowledge, then you're off to a good start already. If not, start small by making simple meals and following easy recipes. You can gradually build up your kitchen skills as you get more comfortable, but trying too much all at once is a good way to fail and get discouraged. Look for books specifically aimed at beginners or search for easy recipes online. Instructions that provide step-by-step pictures are often the easiest to follow along.\n2. Take a class. Look for free and cheap cooking classes in your area. Focus on developing skills that you're specifically interested in developing, and skip any class that will teach you something you already know or will teach you something you have no desire to learn. Local craft stores often offer classes on baking and food decorating. Small markets may have classes on cooking essentials. Check out cooking schools in your area. Even if you don't want to spend time and money on a cooking program, some of these schools offer one-time cooking courses at a discounted price.\n3. Find your niche. Not every domestic goddess needs to love cooking, but learning to enjoy it can motivate you into improving your skills. Try to find something about cooking or baking that you can feel passionate\u2014or at least interested\u2014about. Build up your cooking skills in general, but involve your point of interest as much as possible while doing so. Your passion might be something simple, like baking cookies or mastering stovetop cooking. On the other hand, you might find your attention grabbed by something a little more unique, like gluten-free baking or canning.\n4. Make any necessary adjustments. You might have a full set of cooking and baking skills when all is said and done, but that doesn't mean you will be able to show them all off each and every day. Know when to make a simple meal and when to whip up something more impressive. Learning how to use your cooking to improve and please those you're cooking for is another skill you will need to master. For example, if you're cooking for picky kids, focus on choosing kid-friendly meals instead of trying to impress them with an elaborate meal they won't even eat. When you're cooking for guests, find out about any food allergies or special diets ahead of time and plan your menu accordingly.\n5. Experiment. Once you feel comfortable enough in the kitchen, start using the skills and knowledge you have gained to experiment with your own recipes and tasty creations. Some experiments might be a success while others will likely be a failure. The important thing is simply to keep working at it until your successes vastly outnumber your failures.\n\n\n## Part three: sew and other \"lost\" skills\n\n1. Master the basics of sewing. Sewing is the queen of lost skills, so if you don't know even the most basic stitches, you really aren't alone. At minimum, though, you should know how to sew hems, repair small rips and tears, and attach buttons. Learn a variety of basic stitches, including the straight stitch, the back stitch, the zigzag stitch, and the basting stitch. Invest in a sewing machine. As your sewing skills improve, consider buying a sewing machine of your own. You will probably be glad that you did. Fixing garments and creating projects from scratch will both be much easier if you learn to machine sew as well as hand sew.\n2. Get crafty. Sewing is not the only lost skill worth learning, of course. There is a wide range of other crafts and domestic abilities you can explore. You do not need to master all of them, but picking one or two you'd like to become great at can improve your standing as a domestic goddess. Potential areas of interest could include gardening, crocheting, or knitting. You could also check out community craft websites, like Pinterest, to get more ideas.\n3. Take classes. You can learn a lot by teaching yourself, but sometimes, the best way to learn a new skill or to advance an old one is to take an actual class on it. Look for cheap classes in your area or sign up for a class online.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to fill sandbags?","response":"## Select materials and get ready\n\n1. Purchase polypropylene bags specifically designed for sandbagging. Standard cloth or plastic bags cannot be used to create sandbags since they\u2019ll tear or break apart when they get wet. Purchase some woven polypropylene sandbags that are specifically designed for stacking and keeping water out. You can purchase specialized sandbags online or at a construction supply store. While sandbags come in different sizes, the optimal size is 14\u201318 in (36\u201346 cm) wide and 30\u201336 in (76\u201391 cm) deep. You can get sandbags with drawstrings built into them to make tying easier. If you\u2019re buying bags to build a flood wall, you don\u2019t actually have to tie them, though.\n2. Use a heavy sand or soil mixture to fill your bags. Purchase heavy-bodied sand from a construction supply or gardening store. You can also find it at distribution centers if you live in a state or country that is prone to flooding. Any type of heavy sand will work. Tip: The sand that you find at the beach is usually too fine to fill a sandbag since It will leak through the weaving. Soil will break apart in your bag and leak through the woven bag if it gets wet, but can work if you\u2019re only trying to brace a surface. You can use a mixture of sand and soil if you don\u2019t have enough sand to fill the bags you need. Gravel will work if you\u2019re trying to weigh a surface down, but it is too permeable to keep water out. Clay materials are hard to shape and will make stacking difficult.\n3. Enlist a friend or two to make sandbag filling easier. It can be difficult to keep a sandbag open if you\u2019re filling it yourself. To make the filling process easier, enlist a friend to hold the bag open while you\u2019re shoveling the sand into it. If you\u2019re filling the bags at the site where you\u2019re stacking them, make the process easier by enlisting a third friend to tie and move each bag. You\u2019ll have to be extremely careful when you\u2019re pouring your sand into the bag if you\u2019re doing it yourself. You may become exhausted as well if you\u2019re building a sandbag wall, since lifting and laying the bags requires heavy lifting. Rotate positions every 20 minutes to reduce muscle fatigue.\n4. Put on gloves, boots, and protective eyewear. Sandbags are chemically treated and may irritate your hands, so wear a thick pair of gloves to protect yourself. Put on a pair of protective goggles to keep sand from blowing into your eyes as you work. Wear a thick pair of rubber work boots to protect your feet and keep the sand out. Avoid touching your skin, eyes, or mouth while filling sandbags. Wash your hands and face when you\u2019re done.\n\n\n## Fill a bag\n\n1. Fold the top of the bag over 2-3 times to create a collar. Place your bag on a flat, stable portion of the ground. Grip the top 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of the bag. Fold the top of the bag over 2-3 times to create a collar. This will make pouring easier, and will ensure that the top of the bag doesn\u2019t fall in on itself if you accidentally pour a little sand on it.Tip: If you\u2019ve enlisted other people to help you, have one person hold the collar open in a circular shape so that it\u2019s easier to shovel sand inside. Sandbags should only be filled 2\/3 full. Folding the top of the bag over also makes it easier to see how much sand you\u2019re adding.\n2. Shovel the sand into the opening at the top of the bag. Use a rounded shovel with a good grip to scoop your sand up. Dig your shovel into the sand at a 45-degree angle and scoop it upwards to raise it up. Then, hold the point of your shovel over the collar of the bag and tilt the shovel downwards to empty the sand into the bag. Don\u2019t work too quickly. If you wear yourself out, it\u2019ll become difficult to shovel accurately. If it\u2019s a little windy or you\u2019re having trouble filling the bag, put a large funnel in the mouth of the bag. Pour the sand into the funnel to make the filling process easier.\n3. Stop adding sand once the bag is 2\/3 full. If you overfill the bag, it will be difficult to tie or fold the bag at the top. If the bag isn\u2019t filled with enough sand, your sandbags will shift around when they\u2019re stacked. Continue shoveling your sand into the bag until roughly 2\/3 of the bag is filled. If you have bags with built-in ties at the top, they can be filled until they\u2019re 4\/5 full. Bags with built-in ties don\u2019t require as much room to secure them. Repeat this process until you have the desired number of bags.\n\n\n## Tie the bag\n\n1. Unfold the collar and pull the top of the bag up. Once your bag is filled to the proper level, undo the collar that you folded to make pouring easier. Then, roll the collar up until the fold is undone and pull the fabric at the top of the bag upwards to straighten it out.\n2. Tighten the drawstring and tie the top of bags with built-in ties. If your bag has a built-in tie, pull the drawstring until the neck of the bag is tight. Then, fold the drawstring over itself and pull both ends to tighten it. Tie the bag by creating a knot the same way you tie your shoes. With the drawstrings folded over one another, create a loop in your nondominant hand. Run the other drawstring over and the under the loop. Pull it through the second loop you just made and pull both loops tight to secure it.Tip: There is no official or proper way to tie a sandbag with a drawstring. As long as you can secure the top with a knot, your sandbag will be fine.\n3. Tie the bag using the fabric if your bag is thinner. If your bag doesn\u2019t have a drawstring and the fabric is thinner, you can tie the fabric of the bag to knot it at the top. With the fabric at top pulled up, squeeze the fabric together with both hands. Twist the top of the bag to keep the fabric tight. Then, hold the base of the top with your nondominant hand. Bring the top of the fabric down to make a loop and squeeze the top of the bag through the loop. Pull the top of the bag to tighten your knot and secure the bag. You may have an easier time securing thinner bags if you only fill them so that they\u2019re halfway filled.\n4. Fold the top of the bag on top of itself if you\u2019re building a wall. Sandbags don\u2019t actually need to be tied if you\u2019re creating a wall or laying them on top of one another. To lay a bag without folding it, hold the bag by the top of the fabric as you\u2019re moving it and take it to the location where you\u2019re creating a wall. Then, place the bag at the spot you want to lay it. Pull the top of the bag in opposite directions to turn the opening into a slit. To finish, fold the slit over itself and lay the bag down with fold on the bottom. Bags that are folded on top of themselves will stay in place when they\u2019re stacked in a wall.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Standard cloth

{"instruction":"How to boost your diet with peanut butter powder?","response":"Powdered peanut butter is a versatile ingredient that you can use to add some nutty flavor to any dish. Its low caloric count and limited fat content make it an appealing option for those looking to lose a little weight. It is great for supplementing simple dishes like smoothies or oatmeal. You can also use it to make savory sauces, spreads, or peanut-flavored dishes. Finally, you can mix the powder into any baked good, from brownies to cupcakes and cookies, to add some peanut flavor.\n\n## Enhance your diet\n\n1. Reduce your caloric intake. The main appeal of peanut butter powder is its low calorie count. A tablespoon of powdered peanut butter has about 25 calories compared to the 96 calories in the same amount of regular peanut butter. It is a good option for those looking to lose some weight but still enjoy peanut flavor.\n2. Limit your fat intake. Another appealing feature of powdered peanut butter is its low fat content. 1 tablespoon contains less than 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fat, while the same amount of regular peanut butter has about 8 grams (0.3 oz) of fat. Note that the fat content of peanuts is mostly heart-healthy monounsaturated fats. A single serving of peanut butter powder is 2 tablespoons. One serving contains about 1.5 grams of fat.\n3. Add a little protein or fiber. Powdered peanut butter is great for adding protein and fiber nutrients without adding the extra fat \u2014 1 tablespoon offers 3 to 4 grams (0.11 to 0.14 oz) of protein and 1 gram (0.035 oz) of fiber. This is particularly important for things like baking where the extra fat can alter the finished product.\n\n\n## Supplement simple dish\n\n1. Add it to your smoothies. To add peanut flavor while limiting calories and fat, you can add a tablespoon or two of the powder to your favorite smoothie. For most recipes, about 2 tablespoons (12.28 g) of powder can substitute for 1 tablespoon (16 g) of traditional peanut butter. Besides its lower calorie count, powdered peanut butter also makes your smoothies smoother and less gritty. As a rule of thumb, add 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powdered peanut butter for every 1 cup (250 ml) of smoothie or shake\n2. Mix it into your oatmeal. Instead of adding a regular peanut butter, mix in a spoonful of powdered peanut butter to your bowl of oatmeal. You can stir it with the oats before you add your milk or water, or you can mix it in after your oats are cooked. Pair it with a banana, some dark chocolate, or some berries for a PB&J oatmeal. You can also add peanut butter powder to muesli, quinoa, and other grain-based dishes.\n3. Pour some into your yogurt or granola. If you are making a parfait, you can mix powdered peanut butter into the either the granola or the yogurt. To add some extra flavor to your yogurt, mix in a spoonful of the powder. You can also sprinkle on top of the granola. If you are making your own granola, you can mix in powdered peanut butter for some additional flavor.\n\n\n## Cook with peanut butter powder\n\n1. Use it to make a peanut sauce. You can add powdered peanut butter to any sauce recipe that calls for peanut butter. Simply rehydrate the powder by mixing it with water and then add it to your sauce. Be sure to follow the directions to get the correct amount of peanut powder for the sauce. As a rule of thumb, mixing 4 tablespoons (24.56 g) of peanut butter powder with 1 tablespoon (14.79 ml) of water will give you 2 tablespoons (32 g) of rehydrated peanut butter.\n2. Add it to breading. To add some extra flavor to your breaded meats, try mixing some powdered peanut butter into your breading. Use your traditional breading recipe and simply mix in about 1\/3 as much peanut butter powder as flour our breadcrumbs. You could try this breading on chicken cutlets or pork chops. Consider adding crushed red pepper flakes to the breading for a little extra spice.\n3. Get creative. You can use powdered peanut butter to add some extra flavor to snacks like popcorn or trail mixes. You can also sprinkle it on top of bananas, mix it with your cereal, or add it to pancake batter. If you think that a dish might benefit from some peanut flavor, give it a dash of powdered peanut butter. For example, with a little olive oil and a couple spoonfuls of powdered peanut butter, you can make peanut butter popcorn. For a sweeter treat, consider sprinkling peanut butter powder on top of kettle corn.\n\n\n## Add peanut butter powder to desserts\n\n1. Bake it into baked goods. If you want to give your desserts a little extra peanut flavor, consider adding some peanut butter powder. You can add it to any baked good by substituting peanut butter powder for 1\/3 the amount of flour called for in the recipe. In addition, you can mix in a couple of tablespoons of the powder to any batter. If a recipe calls for 3 cups (375 g) of flour, use 1 cup (294.7 grams) of peanut butter powder and 2 cups (250 g) of flour. If you are making banana muffins, you might add 3 tablespoons (18.42 g) of peanut butter powder to the batter.\n2. Go gluten-free. If you have a gluten intolerance or suffer from celiac disease, you can use peanut butter powder to make a number of desserts that do not require flour. You can make gluten free peanut butter brownies. You can also make gluten-free peanut butter cookies in a matter of minutes.\n3. Make a peanut butter spread. You can make a peanut butter spread in no time using a little peanut butter powder and cream cheese. Simply mix 1 tablespoon (6.14 g) of powder with an 8-ounce (226.8 g) block of cream cheese. If the spread does not have the peanut flavor you want, add sprinkles of the powder and mix until it tastes the way you would like.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make a tube top?","response":"Do you have some old shirts that you no longer wear? Why not turn them into a trendy tube top? If you don't have a t-shirt to spare, get some sewing elastic and stretchy fabric. With a little time and effort, you'll have a bunch of trendy tube tops to wear all summer long.\n\n## Use a shirt\n\n1. Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out. The shirt can be loose or fitted. If the shirt is loose, you will need to insert an elastic to help hold it up. If the shirt if brand new, make sure that its been washed and dried to remove any potential shrinking.\n2. Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits. Try to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time. This way, you will have to do less cutting. When you are done, discard the top part of the shirt, or save it for another project. If you are having troubles cutting straight, use a ruler or measuring tape as a guideline.\n3. Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins. Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube. For a nice, crisp edge, press the folded hem down with a clothing iron.\n4. Sew along the folded edge, leaving a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back. Try to sew as close to the cut edge as you can. You will need the space between the stitching and the folded edge for the elastic. Also, make sure that you leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap between where you started and finished sewing, or you won't be able to get the elastic inside. Try to use a thread color that closely matches your t-shirt. If your sewing machine has a knit fabric setting, try to use that; it usually looks like a standard straight stitch that's broken up by V shapes. Remove the pins when you are done. Also, remember to snip off the loose ends of the threads.\n5. Measure around your chest, just below the armpits, and cut some elastic according to that measurement. This will help hold your tube top up. Even if your shirt was fitted, an elastic might still be a good idea; fitted shirts can loosen over time.\n6. Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use it to guide the through the top hem of your shirt. Find the \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap in your stitching. Push the safety pin through it, and use it to guide the elastic all the way around the top of the shirt. When you reach the gap again, pull the safety pin out. Both ends of the elastic should now be sticking out of the gap. Be careful not to lose the other end of the elastic inside the shirt hem.\n7. Sew the two ends of the elastic together. Overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then sew them down using the smallest stitch you can. Overlapping the ends of the elastic like this will prevent any unsightly bulges. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. Once you have the elastic back through the gap, you can sew the gap shut for a nicer finish.\n8. Wear your tube top. Be sure to wear a strapless bra with it so that you don't have any bra straps showing.\n\n\n## Make a tube top from scratch\n\n1. Measure around your bust and waist. Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances.\n2. Measure from just below your armpits down to your waist. Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement. You will need this extra length for the hems.\n3. Choose your fabric, and spread it out in front of you, wrong-side-up. The best fabric to use for a tube top is stretchy, jersey type fabric, like the kind used to make t-shirts.\n4. Draw a large rectangle according to your measurement. The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.\n5. Fold the rectangle in half, lengthwise, with the right sides together. Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.\n6. Sew along the side edge using a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Pull the pins out as you sew so that you don't accidentally prick yourself. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots, and snip them as close to the fabric as you can.\n7. Press the seam flat with an iron. Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.\n8. Fold the top and bottom of your fabric down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to make the hems. Secure the folds with sewing pins, and press them flat with a clothing iron. The wrong sides of the fabric should still be facing outward at this time.\n9. Sew the top and bottom hems, but leave a \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap on the top hem. You will need this gap to slide the elastic through. When sewing the hems, try to sew as close to the raw\/cut edge as you can, so that you will have enough space for the elastic. When you are done, pull the sewing pins out. Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can. Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.\n10. Measure your around chest, just below the armpits and cut a piece of elastic according to that measurement. This piece of elastic will help keep the tube top up, so make sure it is sturdy.\n11. Clip a safety pin to the elastic, and use it to feed the elastic through the top hem. Find that \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.\n12. Overlap the ends of the elastic be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and sew them down. Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap. At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.\n13.

{"instruction":"How to clean plant leaves?","response":"Clean plants are a beautiful addition to your home and garden, and do a wonderful job of purifying the air. Choose a cleaning method that is safe for your plant, especially if your plant is sensitive to water. Experiment with different shine agents to add a beautiful glow to your plant leaves. Each of these strategies will leave your plants looking clean and shiny.\n\n## Remove dust and grime\n\n1. Wipe large, shiny leaves with a damp cloth. This is the best way to clean large plants, such as rubber plants, that are difficult to move. Dunk your cloth in water and then squeeze out any excess liquid. Gently wipe both sides of all of the leaves to remove any dust and grime. Microfiber cloths or cheesecloths work well for cleaning plants. Clean the leaves each time that you notice dust or dirt building up. This works well for both indoor and outdoor plants such as Gunnera, Plantain Lillies, and Elephant Ears. Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on the cloth if you notice insects eating or landing on your plant.\n2. Use a soft paintbrush to remove dust from plants with fuzzy leaves. Plants with fluffy leaves, such as African Violets, are quite delicate and shouldn\u2019t be wiped. Instead, gently brush any dust or insects off the leaves with a clean, soft paintbrush. If you don\u2019t have a soft paintbrush on-hand, use a pipe cleaner or soft toothbrush instead. Avoid wetting the leaves of fuzzy plants, as this can cause water spots to appear.\n3. Rinse indoor plant leaves with warm water to remove insects and dust. Place your indoor plant in the sink or shower and use the pressure of the water stream to remove any dust and dirt from the plant. The mist from the shower will also help to hydrate the plant\u2019s leaves. Leave the plants to drip-dry and then take them outside to dry in the sunshine. Always use warm water, as cold water can leave spots on the leaves. Don\u2019t wash plants, such as cacti and African Violets, that are sensitive to water. This method works well for Peace Lilies, Sword Ferns, and Devils Ivy.\n4. Dunk small plants into water to quickly get rid of dust. Place your hand over the soil to keep it in place and then turn the plant upside down and submerge the plant in room temperature water. This is a great option for small houseplants and outdoor plants. Allow the plants to drip-dry out of direct light.\n5. Spray compressed air onto cacti to avoid getting them wet. Cacti are used to desert conditions and will often wilt and die if they are over-watered. Spray air from an air compressor can over the spikes to dislodge any dust or dirt from the cacti. Hold the can 10 centimetres (3.9 in) away from the cacti to avoid damaging the spikes. Purchase an air-compressor can from a hardware store or a plant nursery. This works well for both spiky and smooth cacti.\n\n\n## Add shine\n\n1. Rub a thin coat of mayonnaise over the leaves to keep them shiny. Squeeze a little mayonnaise onto a paper towel and wipe it over the leaves. Cover the entire leave with a light enough coat that it cannot be seen. Remove any excess mayonnaise with a clean paper towel. This shiny coating will last for approximately 2 weeks. Simply reapply the mayonnaise to restore the shine of the leaves. This method works for all types of plants.\n2. Cover the leaves in a thin layer of mineral oil for a long-lasting glow. Mineral oil provides a shiny coating for the leaves and helps to prevent dust from accumulating quickly. Simply place a drop of mineral oil onto each leaf and use your fingers to evenly spread it over the top side of the leaf. Use this method on any type of plant. Avoid using coconut or olive oil on the leaves, as this can block the pores of the plant. Keep plants with mineral oil on them out of the direct sun to avoid the leaves from getting burnt. Reapply the mineral oil once or twice per year.\n3. Spray a commercial plant shining product onto the leaves to add sheen. These sprays are specially formulated to keep your plant leaves looking shiny. Liberally spray the product over all the leaves on your plants. If you are spraying outdoor plants, choose a product that is designed for outdoor plants. Purchase a plant shining spray from a plant store. Follow the application instructions on the packet. This is a great option for cacti, as you don\u2019t have to touch the plant.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Clean plants are a beautiful

{"instruction":"How to walk with a sprained ankle?","response":"Before you start walking with a sprained ankle, make sure you get your doctor\u2019s permission so you don\u2019t cause any more damage. Ideally, you should only walk on a sprain that\u2019s mild, and you should periodically strengthen your ankle through exercise so it gets stronger as you go. If you ever feel any pain, stop immediately and see your doctor for medical help.\n\n## Walk on a sprain ankle\n\n1. Apply ice to your ankle as soon as you can after you sprain it. As soon as you can, rest your ankle and put an ice pack on it to decrease the swelling. Keep the ice on your ankle for 10-15 minutes at a time 2-3 times per day to help alleviate some of the pain. As you start to feel more comfortable, ice your ankle only once or twice a day, or whenever it feels swollen.\n2. Take an anti-inflammatory medication to relieve pain and swelling. Opt for ibuprofen or naproxen, and take the recommended dose for your age as it is written on the packaging. However, if you haven\u2019t seen a doctor yet, do that as soon as possible, since your doctor may prescribe a higher dose or more specific medication. A typical over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 400 mg, three times per day. A doctor may prescribe a much higher dose depending on the severity of your injury and your size. The doctor may also prescribe narcotic pain relievers for you if the pain is severe. Always check with your pharmacist or doctor before taking any medication in addition to a prescription. Side effects may include constipation, drowsiness, and addiction if taken for too long a period. Acetaminophen can reduce pain, but does not reduce swelling.\n3. Protect your ankle with a compression bandage, brace, splint, or high-top shoes. If the sprain is severe, the doctor will prescribe a walking boot or a splint for you. If not, try to wrap a compression bandage or brace around your ankle for 1-3 weeks. Wear boots or high-top shoes that can be laced up tight around your ankles for added support. Wearing high heels with a sprained ankle could lead to further injury. If you have to wear dress shoes, choose flats over heels. In addition to using compression bandages, be sure to rest, ice, and elevate your ankle to help alleviate the pain.\n4. Check your surroundings for uneven ground or stairs before walking around. Be aware of where you are going to be walking so that you are not caught off-guard by loose rocks or potholes in a path or sidewalk. If your path looks rough or rocky, try to find a smoother alternative route, or ask a friend for help.\n5. Walk slowly and take small steps. Look out for spills, things on your path that you can trip over, or anything else in your way that might cause further injury. If you try to walk too quickly, you might miss potential hazards in your way. Concentrating on your walking will help you to not only stay safe and prevent injury but will also make you very aware of your pain level and your healing progress. Whenever possible, hold on to railings or ask a friend if you can lean on them for added support.\n6. Pause when needed and shift your weight to your uninjured foot. Listen to your body. If the pain is too intense to keep going, take a break and relieve your injured ankle of pressure by shifting your body\u2019s weight to the other foot. Some pain is unavoidable, but if you cannot maintain a conversation or lose breath as you walk because of the pain, then you should pause and rest.\n\n\n## Strengthen your ankle after a sprain\n\n1. Stretch the ligaments in your ankle with an exercise band or rolled towel. To do this exercise, wrap a resistance band or a large rolled-up towel around the ball of your injured foot and straighten your leg. Then, point your toes up, down, left, and right. For best results, repeat the cycle of motions 10 times and do the exercise 3 times per day. You do not need to wear shoes or supportive braces for this exercise.\n2. Balance yourself on your injured ankle to increase your stability. Make sure you\u2019re standing on a hard, flat surface before you stand on your injured foot. Try not to hold on to anything as you balance, but make sure there\u2019s a railing or wall nearby so you can catch yourself if you need to. As you work to maintain your balance, your ankle will shift back and forth, stretching out and strengthening the ligaments and muscles. You should wear shoes for this exercise to give your foot some traction and prevent a fall. Make this exercise more challenging by using a balance board instead of a flat surface. The tipping motion of the board will force your ankle to act against the movements, increasing its strength and stability.\n3. Draw the alphabet on the floor using your injured foot. Sit in a comfortable chair with both feet resting flat on the floor. Then, with your injured foot, use your big toe to slowly trace the entire alphabet on the floor, one letter at a time. Drawing letters encourages ankle movement in every direction. Repeat up to three times for maximum stretching and strengthening. You do not need to wear shoes for this exercise since you are sitting and do not need the extra support or traction. If you cannot reach the floor, you can draw the letters in the air for a similar result.\n4. Swing your knees from side to side to stretch and strengthen your ankle. As you sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor, slowly swing your knees as far as you can from side to side. Keep your foot pressed flat to the floor and continue for 3 minutes. If you want to wear shoes while doing this exercise, opt for low-profile shoes that will not limit your ankle\u2019s range of motion.\n\n\n## Prevent further injury\n\n1. Rest your sprained ankle after walking to give it some time to heal. By exercising and walking on your sprained ankle, you will be putting a lot of strain on the ligaments. Give them a break by taking the pressure off of them for at least an hour after walking, giving them time to rest and heal.\n2. Ice your ankle to relieve pain and swelling. After walking on your injured ankle, it will probably be swollen and painful because of the stress it was under. Elevate your foot and hold a cold ice pack wrapped in a towel on your ankle for 10-20 minutes. If your ankle is really swollen, you can reapply the ice again after 10 minutes and continue the cycle of 10-20 minutes on, 10 minutes off, until the swelling goes down. A great substitute for an ice pack is a frozen bag of peas because it is cold and easily molds to the body part that you are icing. Wrapping the ice pack in a towel is important because you can damage your skin by applying ice directly to it.\n3. Compress your ankle using an elastic sports bandage. Wrap your foot from the base of your toes to about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above your ankle. Provide extra support by crisscrossing the bandage from left to right in a figure-eight motion around your ankle and heel. Secure it into place with metal fasteners or tape. You want the compression bandage tight enough to give gentle pressure, but not so tight that restricts blood flow. If you have any tingling or discoloration in your toes, remove the bandage and rewrap it looser. It\u2019s not a good idea to sleep with a compression bandage on because it may reduce blood flow.\n4. Elevate your ankle to speed up healing by reducing swelling. When you are sitting or laying down, keep your ankle elevated to reduce swelling by allowing fluid to drain from the injured area. If possible, lay down and keep your ankle elevated above your heart.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to write a pop punk song?","response":"Pop Punk combines the aggressive energy and instrumentation of punk with catchy melodies and hooks of pop music. Begun by The Ramones and Buzzcocks in the 1970s and made famous by bands such as Green Day in the 1990s and Blink-182 in the 2000s, pop punk has been popular and widespread for years. Luckily, there is no wrong way to write a pop punk song and, as far as writing music goes, the genre is relatively easy to learn.\n\n## Write the instrumentals\n\n1. Learn power chords on the guitar to play any pop punk song. Power chords are the backbone of every punk song ever written. They are short, easy to play, and sound great when played loud. A power chord is just three notes -- your index finger on the E or A string, and the next two strings fretted two frets down. You can move this form anywhere on the guitar to play every single chord. For example, an A, G, D, chord would look like:\n\t* \n\t* A-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord |\n\t* |e|----x-----|------x------|-----x------|\n\t* |B|----x----|------x------|-----x------|\n\t* |G|----x----|------x------|-----7------|\n\t* |D|----7----|------5------|-----7------|\n\t* |A|----7----|------5------|-----5------|\n\t* |E|----5----|------3------|-----x------|\n2. Follow the guitar chords on bass to get the basics of pop punk. Bass players have a lot to look forward to in pop punk. If you're stuck or a newbie, quickly repeated 16th notes on the bass (basically playing one note over and over again) can follow the chords on the guitar to instantly fit in. For example, if the guitarist is playing an A-bar chord, you play the A note in time with each one of her chords. From here you can feel free to improvise during chord changes, before switching to the chorus or verse, or if you can think of a fun bass riff. Check out Green Day's \"She,\" which opens with a great but simple bass riff, and note how it follows the guitar, but with subtle flourishes. Rancid's \"Olympia, WA\" is almost straight 16th notes on the bass, carrying the song along.\n3. Focus on your kick, snare, and hi-hat on the drums for a driving, strong beat. You want to keep the song moving forward with a quick, regular beat. Sixteenth notes on the hi-hat, alternating the kick drum and the snare every other note. While there is a lot more to drumming than this, this basic beat can go behind any pop punk song. Big, quick fills on the toms and crash cymbals are the common way to transition into new parts of the song. Pop-punk drummers like Travis Barker are talented musicians who drive the song forward. Focus on keeping time perfectly, especially at high speeds, to become an invaluable drummer.\n4. Start writing a song with just one good guitar riff. 95% of pop punk songs are short, fast, and guitar-driven. Find 3-4 notes or power chords that you think sound good together and make up a short little phrase to repeat. Most pop-punk songs are simple -- find a riff you like and repeat it to write a verse or chorus. Chop up and change your favorite riffs from other bands. Pop-punk is heavily borrowed, adapted, and repeated. In general, three power chords are the bare minimum for a song. Play with the rhythm and timing of your chords to give them a unique spin.\n5. Write a new riff for the chorus or verse, so you have two unique melodies. To be honest, many bands play the exact same chords, just in a different order or tempo (listen to the Ramones for proof). In general, the verse is slower and or muted and the chorus gets louder, faster, and more melodic. When coming up with a chorus:\n\t* Keep it simple -- the chorus should not be hard to follow. Aim for catchy melodies -- this is where you hook people's ears. Add a short, improvised 1-2 bar riff coming in and out of the chorus to mark each change.\n6. Consider coming up with one new section for the breakdown or solo. After hearing the verse and chorus twice, most bands add in one quick, unique section to change the song up. This is called the breakdown, and there is often a solo, different lyrics, or a slow drop and build back to full energy or tempo. They are usually slower, either building up power or leaving room for another instrument to play by itself. If you're struggling to write breakdowns, try to:\n\t* Play the verse or chorus at half-time. Replay or change up the intro riff or melody. Simplify the chords to the 1-2 most important ones, leaving space for vocals or a solo. Drop out certain instruments, then slowly build them back in.\n7. Follow the basic pop song structure when crafting songs. Most pop punk songs begin with an intro, and they usually then follow this order: Intro, first verse, second verse, chorus, third verse, chorus solo and\/or bridge, and then finish with the chorus again or outro. Though some songs will be different, this is the most common structure of a Pop Punk song. Blink-182's \"Dammit\" is an excellent example. All you have to write is a riff for the verse, the chorus, and the bridge. when it comes to solos, they are usually very simple. Occasionally it's just the intro again, and in some cases there are no solos at all\n8. Play the song as fast as possible. Pop punk is not about sitting back quietly. It is about brash, loud, youthful energy. All pop-punk songs should be played as fast as you feel comfortable, and maybe even a little faster. Once you've got the structure down, start thrashing. When you play live, your number one goal is to have high, contagious energy. Quick songs make it much easier to get people jumping around with you. It is rare for songs to go longer than three minutes. Many are even over before the two minute mark.\n9. Pick up influences from other bands and genres to make your songs stand out. Pop-punk, luckily enough, is easily adapted to other influences and ideas. Keep playing music of all types to learn new riffs and styles. It is the best way to make your own song unique. Common genres to blend with pop punk include:\n\t* Ska and Reggae (Rancid, Operation Ivy, Less Than Jake. Country (Social Distortion, Lucero)\n\t* Swing\/Rockabilly (The Misfits, Cobra Skulls).\n\n\n## Write the lyric\n\n1. Come up with one image, idea, or person to write a song about. Pop-punk songs can be about almost anything. Most commonly, however, they talk about love, adolescence, and rebellion. Unlike its older cousin punk, pop-punk songs are focused more on melodies and relatable lyrics than hard-hitting social criticism. Common subjects include:\n\t* Love and heartbreak\n\t* Suburban angst\n\t* Rebellion against school, parents, etc. Joke-y and goofy lyrics\n\t* Growing up.\n2. Focus on a simple, catchy chorus before anything else. Pop music, no matter what subgenre, is about music that hooks the listener in. You want everyone singing or humming your chorus when the song is done. Keep it short, simple, and make sure it sounds great. Whistling the lyrics is a great way to hear the melody. Write lyrics so that they sound great even when you're just whistling. Green Day, Blink-182, Operation Ivy, and Rancid are great bands on their own, but it is their ability to write a catchy, radio-friendly chorus got them famous.\n3. Make verses short, matching the same length and rhyme scheme for each. The easiest way to write song lyrics is in rhyming couplets. Basically, you write one line, then write another line that rhymes with it. These lyrics need to flesh out your chorus and idea. If you're stuck with the verses, you might--\n\t* Tell a story (\"Timebomb\")\n\t* Describe related moments or images about a girl, life, school (\"Story of my Life.\"). Explore a theme or idea, using each verse to talk about a different aspect (\"Longview\").\n4. Consider adding a refrain or sing-along section. The sing-along, often little more than \"lalalas\" \"oooohhhs\" and \"ahhhhhhs,\" is a staple of pop-punk. Often used in the chorus or outro, a good sing-along section is key for a pop-punk section. You don't need one in every song, but even something as simple as \"nananana nanananana\" in \"All the Small Things\" is the difference between a good song and a hit.\n5. Get personal. Pop punk is personal medium. Your own worries, fears, and anger will fit right at home in the lyrics, so don't shy away from personal stories or opinions. Punk is known as an inclusive, do-it-yourself genre, so just be yourself. Even somewhat angsty, emo-type lyrics work well, as evidenced by Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, and Screeching Weasel. Feel free to get weird. The Lillingtons, for example, made their mark with sci-fi inspired songs. Feel free to be funny. Pop-punk has a long history of pranksters and joke songs, from the poppier NOFX songs to the self-awareness of The Steinways.\n","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to measure a bottom bracket?","response":"## Remove the crankshaft\n\n1. Unscrew the bolt or nut in the middle of the crankshaft. Flip your bike upside down or put it on a bike stand. Inspect the crankshaft, which is the big gear on one side of your pedals, to find how the pedal is connected to the crank. Get a socket wrench or screwdriver that fits the nut or bolt. Unscrew this piece by turning your tool counterclockwise and set it aside.Tip: If the nut or bolt is embedded in the crank wheel, use a crank extractor tool to reach the nut or bolt. Insert it into the opening and wrap it around the nut or bolt. Then, use a wrench to turn the tool counterclockwise. You cannot access or measure a bottom bracket without moving the crankshaft. If you\u2019re measuring a bracket that is not installed on a bike, feel free to skip this section. If there is a piece of plastic sitting on top of this nut or bolt, pop it off with a flathead screwdriver. This is the dust cap. Hold the pedal arm in place while doing this to keep it from turning.\n2. Screw the crank extractor tool into the bolt in the middle of the crankshaft. Under the first nut or bolt, there will be a bolt locking the crankshaft in place. Using the threaded side of your crank extractor tool, slide your crank extractor into the opening in the crankshaft and turn it clockwise to tighten it in the threading, if necessary. On some bikes, the crankshaft won\u2019t have any threading for a crank extractor tool. On these bikes, you can simply push the crank extractor tool into the opening and wrap it around the bolt.\n3. Tighten the socket on the open end of the crank extractor tool. With the tool attached to the nut inside of the crankshaft, turn the socket at the end of the tool clockwise by hand. Once it won\u2019t move any further, use a wrench to turn it. Hold the pedal in place to keep the crankshaft in place. Continue turning the socket until it won\u2019t move any further. The socket should move closer towards the crankshaft as you turn it. If it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re turning the socket the wrong way. Turning this socket effectively pulls the side of the crankshaft off of the axle.\n4. Slide the crankshaft off of the bottom bracket. Once the pedal in your hand feels loose, simply slide the crank wheel off of the bottom bracket. The crank extractor tool will still be attached to the crankshaft, so turn the socket counterclockwise to remove it. With the crankshaft off, repeat this process on the other side to remove the remaining pedal. If the shaft doesn\u2019t slide off immediately, jiggle the crankshaft a little while pulling it out. Crankshafts can stick a little if they haven\u2019t been removed in a long time.\n\n\n## Measure the bracket\n\n1. Measure the width of the bracket\u2019s shell using calipers. Flip the bike over or set it on a bike stand if it isn\u2019t already. Inspect the area near your bike\u2019s crankshaft for a horizontal cylinder that connects to your pedals. This is the shell for your bottom bracket. Spread the jaws on your calipers out and slide them around the openings on each side of the shell. Slide the movable jaw on the calipers so that they\u2019re flush against the 2 openings of the shell. Measure your width and write down.Tip: Bottom bracket measurements are kind of confusing. For bracket dimensions, the first number is always the width of the shell. The second number is always the length of the bracket itself from spindle to spindle. Bottom bracket measurements are always taken in millimeters. The most common sizes for the width of the shell are 68 mm and 73 mm. You can use a ruler instead of calipers if you prefer. It\u2019s easier to get a precise measurement with calipers, though. To use your calipers, slide the jaws sticking out of the ruler until they\u2019re flush against 2 surfaces. The number above the hash mark on the movable jaw is your measurement. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike or measure the bracket separately. You still need to measure a bracket\u2019s bike shell though\u2014not the bracket itself\u2014to determine whether a bracket will fit or not.\n2. Calculate the length of the bracket from spindle to spindle. Spread the jaws of your calipers out. Wrap them around the pegs that stick out of the middle of the bracket. Close the jaws so that they\u2019re flush with each exterior edge on your pegs. Write this measurement down after the width. This is the overall length of your bottom bracket. The length typically ranges from 113-122 mm. If you\u2019re replacing a bottom bracket, the length of your new bracket must match the length of your old bracket. If you\u2019re replacing the bracket and the pedals though, your bottom bracket\u2019s length must match the required bracket length of your new pedals. The spindles are the little pegs that stick out of the bottom bracket on both sides. You can do this with the bracket installed on the bike, or measure it separately. If your spindles aren\u2019t circular and have flat sides on them, you have a square-tapered bracket. This is the most common fitting type for bottom brackets and is found on basically every bicycle that isn\u2019t vintage or custom-made.\n3. Check the length from edge to edge if you don\u2019t have spindles. Some bottom brackets don\u2019t have spindles. These brackets are called thread-through brackets. For these brackets, use your calipers to measure from the exterior edge to exterior edge. These brackets are commonly found on custom bikes and newer models.\n4. Measure the inner diameter on the side of the bracket\u2019s shell. Spread the jaws on your calipers and wrap them around the side of the shell where the bracket is exposed on either side. Tighten the calipers around the opening to measure the diameter. Write this number down and label it. If the inner shell diameter is 1.37 inches (35 mm), you have an English bracket. This is the most common type of bottom bracket. On a BMX bike, this measurement will typically be either 19 mm or 22 mm. This measurement will be the same on both sides; don\u2019t bother checking the width on each side. The diameter of the bottom bracket itself is irrelevant since some bottom brackets don\u2019t sit flush on the shell. If your shell is not on the bike, you cannot determine this size without reading the instructions for the bracket.\n5. Determine what kind of bracket tool you need to check the threading. To check the threading type, you\u2019ll need to remove the bracket from the bike. Bottom bracket tools come in different sizes based on the cup holding it in place. To determine what size bottom bracket removal tool you need, count the number of notches on the outside rim of the bracket where the cup rests. The number of notches on the bracket will match the number of notches on your bottom bracket.\n6. Remove the bottom bracket using a removal tool or wrench, if necessary. Start on the bracket on the right. Slide the bottom bracket tool over the spindle and wrap a wrench around it. Turn the bracket tool counterclockwise until the cup holding the bracket in place comes out. Repeat this process by turning the bracket tool clockwise on the left. The bottom bracket will slide right out with the cups off. If the right side won\u2019t loosen when you turn counterclockwise, you probably have an Italian bracket. Try turning clockwise instead. If there are no threading whatsoever, you have a press-fit bottom bracket. To remove these brackets, use an old crankshaft or the head of a hammer to gently push the bracket out of the shell. Always start on the drive side of the bracket. The drive side is always on the right of the bike when you\u2019re sitting on it.\n7. Check the threading on the bracket to see what type you have. Some shells have threading for the bottom bracket while others do not. This means that the threading on your bottom bracket must match the threading on the shell. Inspect the direction of the threading on each end of the bracket. If both sides are installed by turning counterclockwise, you have an Italian bottom bracket. If the right-hand side is installed clockwise and the left-hand side is installed counterclockwise, you have an English bracket. If there is no threading in the shell, you have a thread-together bottom bracket and you do not need to worry about threading. The English and Italian brackets are found on the vast majority of bikes. A French bracket refers to an English bracket with smaller threading.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The crankshaft is the big gear on one side

{"instruction":"How to write a confirmation letter?","response":"There are several different types of confirmation letters, each requiring a slightly different format. Basic confirmation letters written to confirm the details of a meeting, event, or other arrangements are typically brief and to the point. Employment confirmation letters usually include specific terms and conditions, so they may be longer. If you are called upon to write a letter for someone receiving the Catholic sacrament of Confirmation, your letter will be significantly more personal.\n\n## Confirm an employment offer\n\n1. Use business letter format on company letterhead. A formal business letter on company letterhead sets the appropriate tone and establishes the letter as official business communication. Set a standard font and margins, typing the body of the letter in block-paragraph style \u2013 single-spaced, with a double-space between paragraphs. Avoid using any abbreviations when you type addresses in formal business letters. For example, instead of typing \"123 Main St.,\" you would type \"123 Main Street.\" If your letterhead includes the address for your business, you can typically eliminate the address block for yourself.Tip: Government and small business agencies may have templates you can download for free that cover all the legal requirements for a formal offer of employment letter.\n2. List the job title, salary, and start date. Begin your letter with an enthusiastic tone, welcoming the recipient to the company in their new capacity. You might also include a brief summary of the recipient's job duties unless the job title makes them obvious. For example, you might write: \"On behalf of Bob Builders, Inc., I am pleased to offer you the position of Secretary at a salary of $28,500 a year. Your first day will be January 22, 2019.\"\n3. Summarize the terms and conditions of the offer. If there are any limitations to your offer they should be clearly stated. Additionally, if the offer is contingent on anything, those contingencies should be stated up front. For example, the offer may be contingent on a clean background check, or a clean drug test. This section may also include any documents the new employee needs to sign, such as a confidentiality agreement or a non-compete agreement. If you include any contingencies, provide the new employee with a deadline by which those things need to be completed. If you're only asking for documents to be signed, you might state that those documents can be signed on the new employee's first day.\n4. Provide details about any benefits your company offers. If your company offers health insurance, retirement benefits, educational assistance, paid time off, or other benefits, list those briefly. Let the new employee know when they will be eligible for those benefits, and how they can find out more information about them. Some employers start benefits at day one, but most require employees to work 60 or 90 days before they become eligible for benefits.Tip: While an employment confirmation letter may end up being more than one page, try to make it no longer than two pages. Remove details that the recipient can find on other documents they receive.\n5. Close by thanking the recipient. Let the recipient know that you're grateful for their interest in your company and that you're glad they're coming to work with you. Communicate your excitement or enthusiasm for having the new employee join your team. For example, you might say \"Thank you so much for your interest in our mission here at Bob Builders, Inc. We're excited to bring you on board and look forward to your contributions.\" Use a formal closing immediately before your signature, such as \"Sincerely\" or \"Sincerely yours.\"\n6. Include your job title under your name. The business letter template provides 4 blank lines for your signature after the formal closing. Under that space, type your first and last name. Under your name, type your job title and the name of the company. For example, you might type \"Director of Operations, Bob Builders, Inc.\"\n7. Proofread your letter carefully. Make sure your letter is free of any typos and spelling or grammatical errors. You may also want someone from human resources to read over the letter and verify that all the content is correct. Double-check numbers in particular. It's easy to transpose digits by mistake, and this can lead to a huge misunderstanding. These types of mistakes could also have legal consequences.\n8. Print and sign your letter for mailing. Your letter will look more professional if printed on quality paper. Even if you send an email confirmation, mail an official signed copy as well. Sign the letter in the space provided, using blue or blank ink. Include any credentials, such as \"CPA\" or \"JD,\" if appropriate. Mail the letter promptly, so that your new employee will receive it well before their planned start date.Tip: It also looks more professional to type the envelope. Most word-processing apps have templates you can use to place the addresses correctly on the envelope.\n\n\n## Write a catholic confirmation letter\n\n1. Start with a statement about the importance of confirmation. The sacrament of Confirmation deepens baptismal grace, strengthening the bond between the confirmand and the Church. Address the confirmand personally, and congratulate them for taking this step and receiving this sacrament. For example, you might say \"As you prepare to receive the sacrament of Confirmation, I am honored to support you as you take this important step to deepen your bond with Christ and the Church.\" Use words and phrases from the Catholic Catechism to stress the importance of this step in the confirmand's journey of faith.\n2. Discuss your relationship with the recipient. Use shared memories and experiences to encourage and build up the confirmand. Supplement your stories with verses from Scripture or other sources. Choose stories or events that demonstrate your love for the recipient and their journey in the faith. For example, you might discuss memories of when the recipient was baptized. Questions the recipient may have asked you about the Church or about your faith are also good jumping-off points for reflection. Don't worry about making this long or overly detailed. Brevity can also be powerful.Tip: It may help to outline your letter before you start writing it. Be prepared to go through several drafts to get it right.\n3. Include encouraging or inspirational quotes from Scripture. Use quotes to further express the meaning of the sacrament and the teachings of the Church. You can search online or use the Bible's concordance to find quotes that resonate with you. For example, you might try \"The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.\" (Proverbs 18:10). Another encouraging quote is \"For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.\" (Jeremiah 29:11). You might also try \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\" (Philippians 4:13).\n4. Assure the recipient that they have your support. Close your letter by letting the recipient know that you support them on their journey and are praying for them. Thank the recipient for being in your life and bringing you love and joy. For example, you might write \"I am extremely proud of you, and all the blessings you have brought to my life. I am honored to be your Confirmation sponsor, and pray that you will continue to grow in faith, hope, and charity. \"Variation: If you know the recipient's confirmation name, you might close your letter with a prayer to that saint.\n5. Write your final letter by hand to make it more personal. Formal letters are typically typed. However, a handwritten confirmation letter feels more personal and authentic, as though it came straight from the heart. This can be a great touch to add. If you're going to write your letter by hand, go slowly. Write as neatly as possible, and make sure you aren't introducing any errors. It can help to type your letter out first and then copy it.\n\n\n## Draft other formal confirmation letter\n\n1. Type your letter in formal business letter format. A formal business letter communicates that you are serious and sets the proper tone for your letter. Most word processing apps include a business letter template that you can use to type your confirmation letter. Use a standard font, such as Times New Roman or Arial. In a legal sense, a confirmation letter also may be used to create a record of an agreement made orally. The formal business letter format is appropriate, as these letters may be used as evidence in court. Because confirmation letters are typically extremely brief, you may find that your letter only has a single paragraph. It should never be longer than a page.\n2. Use an appropriate salutation. Typically you'll start the salutation line with the word \"dear,\" followed by \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" and the first and last name of the recipient of the letter. Place a colon at the end of the person's name to start the letter. If the person is a doctor, use \"Dr.\"\n\t* If you don't know the recipient's gender identity, simply use their first and last name. Don't use the abbreviation \"Mrs.\" unless you know the recipient is a married woman who prefers that title.\n3. Confirm the specific arrangement made. There's no reason for any extended introduction or pleasantries in a confirmation letter. Get straight to the point of the event or arrangement you're confirming. This will likely include dates, times, and locations. For example, you might start the letter \"This letter is to confirm\" or \"I am writing to confirm,\" followed by the information you're confirming. If you're writing to confirm receipt of something, you can start your letter \"I am pleased to confirm,\" or \"I was pleased to receive,\" followed by a list of the specific items you received.Err on the side of formality. You can be more personable when confirming a personal arrangement made with someone you know well. But generally, keep your tone formal and professional.\n4. Include any other important information. Other details may include the names and roles of other people involved, specific tasks, conditions of the arrangement, or monetary agreements. Repeat any terms or conditions that were part of the agreement to clarify what is expected. For example, if you're writing to confirm that the recipient will volunteer at a nonprofit event, you might want to include the day, time, and location of the event, as well as specific acts the volunteer will be expected to perform.\n5. Ask for a follow-up if needed. Towards the end of your letter, let the recipient know if you need them to contact you and provide additional information. If your confirmation included a request or an assignment of responsibilities, ask them to confirm their agreement on those terms. Even if you don't have anything specific for the person to contact you about, it's usually a good idea to include a line with your preferred method of communication and let them know that they can contact you if they have any further questions. For example, you might write \"If you have any questions or comments, you can reach me at (999) 444-1212.\"\n6. Thank the recipient. Start a new paragraph and add a line thanking the recipient for joining you in the arrangement or agreeing with you on the terms, whatever is appropriate to the subject of the letter. For example, if you are confirming someone's agreement to volunteer at a nonprofit event, you might say \"Thank you so much for your commitment to our cause. We are grateful for all of your effort.\" Make a statement of your enthusiasm, if appropriate. For example, if you are writing to confirm a job interview, you might say \"I appreciate the opportunity\" or \"I look forward to talking to you.\"\n7. Edit and proofread your letter before printing. Your confirmation letter won't be taken seriously if it includes typos or grammatical errors. In addition to proofreading, make sure your writing is as clear and concise as it can be. Reading your letter aloud can help you pick up on places where your writing could be simpler and more direct, as well as making it easier to notice mistakes. Edit out legalese or other industry jargon. Be clear and direct about what you're confirming.\n8. Print your letter on quality paper. Once you're confident your letter is error-free, print it on a premium, stationery paper. You can buy small quantities of this type of paper in office supply stores or online. If you're sending the letter in your capacity as an employee or representative of a business or organization, use the letterhead of that business or organization. However, if you're writing to confirm a personal matter, don't use the business letterhead \u2013 even if you own the business. Most word processing apps have templates you can use to create your own personal letterhead if you want your letter to look a little more polished.\n9. Sign the letter using blue or black ink. After you've printed the letter, sign it neatly in the space you provided over your typed name. Try to keep your signature professional and reasonably legible, without being excessively stylistic. Sign your first and last name exactly as it is typed. It's typically not appropriate to use a nickname or abbreviation when signing a confirmation letter.\n10. Send your letter to the recipient promptly. Try to get your letter in the mail the same day you sign it. You won't make a good impression if the date of your letter is several days before the date of the postmark. If the letter is confirming something that could possibly have legal significance, make a copy of the confirmation letter for your own records before you mail it.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to go to amarnath temple?","response":"## Plan and prepare for the trip\n\n1. Plan to visit between June and August. Since snow and ice usually cover the cave temple, you won\u2019t be able to access it during the cold winter and spring months. Wait until mid-June or July to plan your trip to the Amarnath Temple. Usually, the cave stays open through the first 1\u20132 weeks of August before it closes due to the terrain getting too difficult for travel. The actual dates when you can travel to the temple are chosen by the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) and it varies depending on the weather and how clear the trails are. You will not be able to reach the Amarnath Temple at any other time of the year.\n2. Get a Compulsory Health Certificate by a doctor approved by the SASB. Look at the list of approved doctors on the SASB website and schedule an appointment to see one. Bring the Compulsory Health Certificate from the site with you and fill out the self-assessment on top. Allow your doctor to run any tests to check if you\u2019re fit for traveling to the Amarnath Temple. If they approve you for traveling, then you\u2019ll be able to make the journey.You can find the Compulsory Health Certificate for 2020 here: http:\/\/www.shriamarnathjishrine.com\/Yatra2019\/CHC%20form%20for%20Yatra%20-%202020.pdf. The certificate you need changes each year, so make sure you\u2019re using the proper one. Since the Amarnath Temple is 4,000 metres (2.5 mi) above sea level, it\u2019s possible to get altitude sickness if you aren\u2019t fit enough for the trip.Warning: You will not be allowed to go to Amarnath Temple if you are under 13, over 75, or more than 6 weeks pregnant.\n3. Submit a registration form online to the SASB. Select the date you want to travel to the temple on the calendar at the top of the page. Fill out the personal details on the registration form completely, including your name, birthday, phone number, and address. Then, list the clinic and doctor that completed your Compulsory Health Certificate. Upload a photograph of yourself and a scanned copy of the certificate before submitting the registration form.You can find the online registration form here: http:\/\/jksasb.nic.in\/register.aspx. If you are accepted to travel to the temple, you will receive a text or email message about how to pay the 50 INR ($0.70 USD) fee. When you receive a permit, you must keep a copy on you at all times during your trip.\n4. Start taking 4\u20135 km (2.5\u20133.1 mi) walks 1 month prior to your trip. Start building up your endurance at least 1\u20132 months before your scheduled date of departure. Try to take the walks in the early morning or evening so you can get used to breathing in cool air. Continue taking walks each day up until you leave so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you hike to the temple.You can also practice deep breathing exercises and yoga so you\u2019re able to improve your oxygen efficiency. This will help you breathe easier when you\u2019re at a higher altitude since there isn\u2019t as much oxygen in the air.\n5. Pack warm clothes, waterproof shoes, a water bottle, and a walking stick. Only bring a lightweight, waterproof bag so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you\u2019re trekking to the temple. Opt for wool clothes that are waterproof so you stay warm. Make sure you use waterproof trekking shoes and a walking stick so you\u2019re easily able to traverse more difficult terrain. Since you'll be active, opt for a reusable water bottle as well.Other things you may need for your trip include an umbrella, flashlight, hat, gloves, and a raincoat. The weather can be unpredictable and temperatures may dip below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) during the night. You don\u2019t have to bring tents or sleeping bags since there will be sites where you can spend the night.\n\n\n## Get to the temple\n\n1. Choose the Pahalgam route for an easier trek that lasts 3\u20135 days total. Select Pahalgam as your starting point if you want to follow the traditional pilgrimage route to the temple. While the trip does take longer to complete, it doesn\u2019t have any steep slopes that are difficult to climb, and you can ride or use ponies during most of the ascent. You will hike about 48 kilometres (30 mi) if you go from Pahalgam to the Amarnath Temple. You don\u2019t have to pay any additional fees to take the Pahalgam route.\n2. Pick the Baltal route for a steep climb that only takes 1\u20132 days round trip. If you\u2019re an experienced climber or you feel like making the trip within a shorter amount of time, opt to start in Baltal, which is just north of the temple. Though the route from Baltal is much steeper than the path from Pahalgam, you can make the round-trip journey within a day.Plan to hike about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) using the Baltal route. If you\u2019re too tired to descend back to Baltal, you can opt to stay at a camp at the top overnight before leaving the next day. There are no other fees to take the Baltal route.Warning: Ponies are not allowed on the Baltal route since it\u2019s too steep, so you will have to walk the entire way.\n3. Fly into Srinagar to get the closest to either base camp. Look for flights that come into the Srinagar International Airport, since it\u2019s only 2\u20133 hours from both Pahalgam and Baltalhead. Try to schedule your flight into the airport 1\u20132 days before the date you\u2019re scheduled to go to Amarnath Temple so you have time to travel.You can also fly or take a train to Jammu, but you\u2019ll need to drive or take a bus further to to the base camps.\n4. Take a bus or taxi to the base camp you selected. Look for a bus or taxi service that runs from Srinagar to either Pahalgam or Baltal, depending on which route you plan on traveling. Typically, your ride will only last around 2\u20133 hours, but it may take longer depending on the road conditions.If you have a vehicle, you can also drive yourself to the base camps. Usually, there is some on-site parking, but it may be busy due to the number of travelers for the pilgrimage.\n5. Hire a helicopter tour if you don\u2019t want to hike all the way to the temple. Helicopters fly out from both Pahalgam and Baltal, so you can reserve them for either base camp. Choose the date that you want to travel to the temple and reserve your spot. Arrive at the helicopter port on your scheduled day and take it up toward the temple. The helicopter will be able to take you as close as 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) away, but you will need to hike the rest of the way.Typically, a helicopter tour will cost around 3,600 INR ($50 USD) for a round trip.\n\n\n## Trek to the cave\n\n1. Carry your belongings in a waterproof bag. Store your clothes and everything you\u2019ve brought with you in a waterproof bag or backpack so they don\u2019t get wet. Use a bag that fits tightly on your shoulders and back so it doesn\u2019t cause any strain while you climb up to the temple. Make sure you zip the bag at all times so water doesn\u2019t leak inside or get your things wet. Weather can be unpredictable during your ascent, so it may snow or rain while you\u2019re climbing to the temple.\n2. Stop at tea stalls or small restaurant huts for meals and drinks. Look for small huts or stands along the route to the temple to see what kind of food and drinks they offer. Pay for the rations and enjoy them at one of the camps along the route. Otherwise, save non-perishable food in your bag so you can have it later during your trek.Some stalls may charge for food while others volunteer and provide meals for free.Tip: Always carry some back-up snacks, such as dried fruits or nuts, with you so you can eat as you get hungry.\n3. Protect your skin with sunscreen or petroleum jelly. Keep a bottle of sunscreen or petroleum jelly in your bag so you have access to it whenever you need it. Apply it to your exposed skin and rub it in until it\u2019s clear so it can absorb fully. After 2 hours, put on another layer so you stay protected from the sun.Petroleum jelly can also help keep your skin from drying out due to the cold, dry air.\n4. Rest at the camps set up along the route. Look for tents and huts along the route where you\u2019re able to rest for the night during your trip. Pay for tent rental and take time to relax so you don\u2019t feel too exhausted when you reach the shrine. Make sure your clothes aren\u2019t wet before you fall asleep so you don\u2019t get cold at night.If you\u2019re shivering, slurring speech, experiencing blurry vision, or feeling nauseous, you may be experiencing altitude sickness. Rest as soon as possible and avoid climbing any higher.\n5. Pray to Shiva at the ice lingam when you reach the holy shrine. When you reach the Amarnath Temple, take off your shoes and enter the cave to see the ice lingam, which is a tall column of ice that\u2019s considered holy. Say a prayer to Shiva while you\u2019re next to the lingam before exiting the shrine.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Snow and ice usually cover

{"instruction":"How to flip someone off with style?","response":"Flipping someone off is a classic nonverbal signal for showing anger and frustration toward a person. You might \"flip the bird\" to someone who has cut you off, insulted you, or otherwise provoked your ire. At its simplest, flipping someone off is just pointedly displaying your middle finger in their direction. More advanced techniques take on an element of comedy or performance art. Remember: when you flip someone off, you are calling him or her out \u2013 so use with caution, or be prepared for the consequences!\n\n## Basic flip-off move\n\n1. Give someone the finger. There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic \"flip-off.\" Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across. Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.\n2. Try using both hands. For added effect, whip out the \"double-finger\" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry. Do \"the X\": cross your middle fingers into an \"X,\" and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.\n3. Switch fingers. For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.\n\n\n## Discreet flip-off move\n\n1. Act like you are itching your nose. Reach up to your face as though you are going to itch your nose or your face. Look in the direction of the person that you want to flip off. Then, use your middle finger to scratch your nose while staring pointedly. The person that you are flipping off might not notice this move. However, it might give other onlookers a laugh.\n2. Flip the person off behind their back. You might feel a bit better simply by releasing your anger somehow, even if the person in question doesn't actually see you. Consider whether you want to provoke a confrontation, or just get your feelings out.\n\n\n## Theatrical flip-off move\n\n1. Do the \"jack-in-the-box\" flip-off. Hold your fist out in front of you, knuckles facing the offender \u2013 but do not raise your middle finger yet. Then, make a fist with the other hand, and crank it in circles next to the first hand as though you are winding up an old-timey jack-in-the-box toy. As you crank, hum \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" the tune traditionally associated with jack-in-the-boxes. Hum and crank faster and faster as you approach the end of the tune. Then, at the final \"Pop\" of the \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" tune, extend your middle finger as though it is the jack popping out of the box. Finish humming the tune while flipping the person off. Make sure that you have the person's undivided attention. This move takes a bit of time to pull off, and you want to make sure to get the full effect.\n2. Practice \"the balloon.\" Hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth. Act as though you are blowing up a balloon: \"blow\" into your thumb, and slowly extend all of your fingers as though your breath is inflating them. Then, hold you middle finger of the \"balloon hand\" with your other hand, and move the thumb away from your mouth. Slowly close the other fingers on your \"balloon hand\" until only your middle finger is left pointing at the person whom you want to flip off.\n3. Pretend to \"find\" your middle finger. Act as though you are looking for something: in your pocket, or between the couch cushions, or in a desk drawer. Make sure that you get the person's attention. Then, make a show of being relieved that you have found the thing you're looking for. Turn to show the person what you found: and flip them off! Alternately, lean down in front of the person as though you are picking something up off of the ground. Come up flashing your middle finger, and say, \"Did you drop this?\"\n4. Try \"the trumpet.\" Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet, and flail your fingers as though you are hitting the valves. Periodically hold up only your middle finger. Add some musical effects for style!\n5. Try the \"double extreme.\" Extend the middle fingers of both hands. Then, bring your arms behind your back and through your legs. You should have both middle fingers clearly presented. Note: only people with long arms can pull this off.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Creative writing","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to be creative when playing with your barbies?","response":"There are endless fun possibilities when it comes to playing with Barbies. If you need ideas for activities, consider doing things like creating a beach for Barbie, pretending she's a doctor to help sick patients, or hosting a fashion show to show off all of her clothing. You can also create things for Barbie, such as furniture to go in her house or new clothing for her to wear.\n\n## Do activities with barbie\n\n1. Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie. If you bought a playhouse just for Barbie, great! If not, empty a bookshelf or stack empty boxes on top of one another on their sides to create your own. You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie.\n2. Turn Barbie into a doctor to have her help patients. Pretend that Barbie is a doctor or nurse and create an office for her to see sick patients. Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll\u2019s broken arm or ankle.\n3. Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot. Use an outdoor sandbox, sandy section of your yard, or build your own beach by pouring sand into a plastic tub indoors. Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie\u2019s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an \u201cocean.\u201d\n4. Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair. To smooth out any tangles in Barbie\u2019s hair, dip her hair in a mixture of fabric softener and water and then use a brush to brush out the tangles. Curl Barbie\u2019s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. To curl Barbie\u2019s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie\u2019s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair.\n5. Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things. Set up a school room with rows of chairs and desks for the doll students to sit and learn, and have Barbie write lessons on a chalkboard to teach everyone things like math, science, or foreign languages. You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn\u2019t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line.\n6. Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone. This could be an action movie where Barbie is involved in a high-speed car chase, a romantic movie where Barbie falls in love with someone, or any other genre that you like. Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you\u2019ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued.\n7. Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car. Pack up Barbie\u2019s car with snacks, clothing, and any other gear she\u2019ll need for a road trip, or use your imagination and use a cardboard box as her car. Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival.\n8. Create a pool for Barbie using a sink or plastic container. Fill a bowl or plastic container with water and dress Barbie up in her swimsuit so that she can go swimming. Make sure Barbie is able to get wet before dipping her in the water, especially if she has a special hairdo. Have Barbie throw a pool party and invite her friends. Play music, have Barbie sit on a pool towel next to the pool, or let her practice doing fun dives into the water.\n9. Put on a fashion show using Barbie\u2019s clothing. Dress Barbie in fancy dresses, businesswoman attire, lounge wear, or in crazy costumes. Use the clothing you already have for Barbie, or create new clothing using materials around your house such as balloons, pieces of fabric, or old socks. Play music while putting on the fashion show so that Barbie can strut down the runway. For example, dress Barbie up like a princess, astronaut, ballerina, basketball player, or celebrity.\n\n\n## Make clothe and furniture for barbie\n\n1. Cut up balloons to make clothing for Barbie. Cut both ends of the balloon off using scissors to create a skirt or strapless dress, or design more detailed shirts and dresses by cutting arm holes into the balloon. Slide the balloon up over Barbie\u2019s body starting at her feet once you\u2019re done. The balloon should be deflated to use it as clothing.\n2. Create a dress out of a piece of fabric. Look around the house to find spare pieces of fabric used for sewing or projects. To make a super simple dress, cut a circle out of the fabric with a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm). Cut a small hole for Barbie\u2019s head right in the middle, and then 2 arm holes on either side. Slide the dress over Barbie\u2019s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. Make sure the main hole in Barbie\u2019s dress is big enough for her head to fit through. Design more complicated pieces of clothing, such as pants or long-sleeve shirts, if desired.\n3. Cover sponges in fabric to create a comfy couch. Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch.\n4. Stack empty matchboxes on top of one another to form drawers. You can color, paint, or cover the outside of the matchboxes with paper beforehand, if desired. Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie\u2019s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures.\n5. Turn a shoebox into a bed for Barbie. Find an old shoebox from your closet, garage, or other storage spot and empty it out. Place a washcloth or small blanket inside, as well as something that will be used as a pillow. Now Barbie has a bed ready for sleeping! Create a pillow by stuffing a piece of fabric or a cloth bag with tissues or stuffing. Decorate the sides of the bed using markers, pencils, or paint.\n6. Tie ribbon onto a small hair band to make a tutu for Barbie. Find an extra hair tie and ribbon that you like. Cut the ribbon into 6 in (15 cm) sections, and then tie the ribbon onto the hair tie so that the middle of the ribbon is where the knot is. Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won\u2019t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size.\n7. Design chairs using cardboard and paper clips. Use scissors to cut cardboard into strips that are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs. Fold a 6 in (15 cm) long piece of cardboard in half to create a simple chair. Fold a 9 in (23 cm) long piece of cardboard into thirds to form a chaise lounge.\n","primary_tag":"Brainstorming","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to get a free room upgrade in las vegas?","response":"Las Vegas is home to high rollers, high stakes, and high hotel rates. In Vegas, the land of risk and reward, it is possible to lodge in style at a discounted rate. With a little finesse and a willing hotel clerk, you can upgrade your generic room to a swanky suite for free.\n\n## Book your room\n\n1. Visit Vegas at the right time. The dates of your visit to Vegas may increase your chances of receiving a free room upgrade. Travel experts, however, have conflicting opinions on the \u201cright time\u201d to visit Vegas. Visit during a period of low occupancy. According to some travel experts, if you want a free upgrade, reserve a room during a period of low-occupancy. For example, if the hotel is known to host businessmen and women during the week, book a stay on a weekend when there will be more suites available. Visit during a conference or event. Other travel experts insist that you are more likely to receive a free upgrade when all of the basic rooms are booked. This typically occurs during a conference or an event. Hotels may offer you a free upgrade to prevent you from switching hotels and to open up a less expensive room for a conference or event goer.\n2. Choose the right hotel. Some Vegas hotels and casinos are more likely to offer free upgrades than others. Before booking a hotel, conduct a quick search to determine which Vegas hotels and casinos are most likely to upgrade your room. You may wish to quickly survey friends, family, and contacts on social media. New hotels may be more likely to upgrade your room because they want a positive review.\n3. Book directly with the hotel. Hotel clerks are aware when you have reserved a room through a third party website. While booking through these sites may guarantee a better rate, it may also result in you being placed in a sub-par room with little chance of receiving a complimentary upgrade. Clerks are more willing to reward customers that book directly with the hotel. If you see a lower rate on a third party site, call the hotel and ask if they will match it.\n4. Book a more expensive room. In order to receive a free room upgrade, consider spending a little more money on the initial reservation. When a guest books a mid-range room over a basic room, the hotel makes more money. The customer staying in the more expensive room automatically becomes more valuable than a customer staying in a basic room. As a result, hotel clerks are more receptive to the needs and requests of a customer that has booked a more expensive room.\n5. Pay with the right credit card. When you book with certain credit cards, such as American Express, you may be automatically eligible to receive a free upgrade. This perk is typically only available to centurion or platinum cardholders. If you belong to a lower card holding class, however, it never hurts to ask if you qualify for a free room upgrade. If you are unsure of the perks offered by your credit card company, call a representative for clarification, conduct a quick internet search, or read through your welcome packet information.\n\n\n## Tip at check-in\n\n1. Check-in at a later time. Throughout the day, hotels gain a better understanding of their occupancy levels and available rooms for that evening and the days immediately following. You are more likely to benefit from this information, if you check-in at a later time. Arrive at the hotel in the late afternoon to evening.\n2. Prepare your tip. Prior to approaching the front desk, discretely prepare your tip. Fold your bill in half neatly. Insert the bill between your credit card and ID. The amount you tip is entirely your choice. Most people will slip clerks at least a twenty dollar bill.\n3. Observe the front desk attendants. Once you arrive (preferably late), take a moment to observe the hotel clerks. Identify a clerk that looks confident, competent, and not in charge. Once you have selected the clerk you want to assist you, approach him or her at the desk. If the clerk you have selected is not immediately available, allow a guest to go in front of you. Do not ask while other guests are around.\n4. Ask for what you want. When requesting a free upgrade, specificity and the word \u201ccomplimentary\u201d are key. If you do not ask for what you want, you may just end up with a room on a higher floor; if you leave out the word \u201ccomplimentary,\u201d the clerk may assume that you are willing to pay for the upgrade. After providing the clerk with your name, smile and slide your cards and tip across the desk. Tell the clerk that you are really interested in checking out a specific suite. Ask \u201cif there are any available complimentary upgrades?\u201d\n5. Thank the clerk. No matter the outcome, always treat the clerk politely. If the clerk upgrades your room, smile and thank them profusely. If the clerk does not upgrade your room, don\u2019t berate them. Instead, smile and thank them for their time and effort. If the clerk can upgrade your room, they will do so. If the clerk cannot upgrade your room, they should return your tip. You may choose to take back the bill or leave it with the clerk. Hotels are more inclined to help and reward guests that are nice, generous, and polite. From the moment you make your reservation, treat every member of the staff with respect. Any staff member, from the bellboy to the manager, could make your complimentary room upgrade possible.\n\n\n## Explore alternative methods\n\n1. Ask for a complimentary upgrade. When you simply ask for an upgrade, instead of discretely slipping the clerk a tip, you are taking a minimal risk that could result in major rewards. While checking in, nicely ask the clerk if there are any complimentary upgrades available. If there are, the clerk may be inclined to grant your request. If they can\u2019t offer you an official upgrade, they may transfer you to a room of a same rate that has a better view or is in a better location. If there are no free upgrades, ask how much it would cost to improve your room. The clerk may provide you with a discounted rate if they know you are willing to pay. Do not ask while other guests are around.\n2. Take advantage of a special occasion. When hotels learn that a guest has chosen to celebrate a special event at their establishment, they are honored. Special occasions provide them with a chance to show off. They will strive to make your stay special and memorable. When booking the room, mention that while you are there you will celebrate a special occasion, such as an anniversary, birthday, or honeymoon. While checking in, subtly mention that you are there for a special occasion. The clerk may then choose to upgrade your room or at the very least provide you with a surprise, such as champagne and chocolates.\n3. Be loyal to the hotel chain. Loyal hotel guests receive special treatment. Joining the hotel\u2019s loyalty program may help you distinguish yourself as a loyal guest. You will also rack up reward points that could lead to a free upgrade or even a free stay.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to react if you see a suicidal post on facebook?","response":"## Respond on facebook\n\n1. Comment and encourage the person to seek help. Many people ignore suicidal social media posts for various reasons. However, social media suicide threats should be considered as serious as any other suicide threat. You may want to reply back to the person or send them a private message where you encourage them to seek help. Consider sending them the numbers to a suicide hotline to talk with a trained suicide counselor. Two suicide hotline numbers you can give them are 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Suicide.org provides suicide hotlines broken down by state, and also provides international numbers. They also give numbers for Spanish speaking hotlines, and hotlines geared towards specific groups, such as LGBT youth and military veterans.\n2. Report the post. When you see a suicide status update on Facebook, you have the option to report the post. When you report the post, it alerts Facebook that the poster may need help. Facebook then sends the person a message asking them if they would like to talk to someone (like a helpline worker) or be sent some tips to help them work through the problem. Reporting the post is anonymous, so the poster won\u2019t know you reported them. To find the \u201cReport Post\u201d link, look for the arrow in the top right of the status box. When you hit the arrow, it should give you the option to \u201cReport Post.\u201d\n3. Use Facebook\u2019s \u201cReport Suicidal Content\u201d option. When you see a suicidal message on Facebook, you can report them directly to Facebook. This option is different than simple reporting the post. You find the \"report suicidal content\" page in Facebook's help section and provide information directly to Facebook. You will need to provide the person\u2019s name, the link to their profile, a link to the suicidal content, and a screenshot of the post.\n\n\n## Help the person\n\n1. Contact the person\u2019s family and friends. If you see a suicide threat but are not close enough to the person to contact them yourself, reach out to the person\u2019s family or friends. They may not be aware of the post. Let them know what you saw on Facebook and that you are worried about the poster. The person\u2019s family and friends may be able to reach the person better than you can. They may be aware of a suicide plan already in place that you don\u2019t know about. For example, you may say, \"I saw a post on Jane's Facebook page where she threatened to commit suicide. I am concerned about her and wasn't sure if you knew about this post.\"\n2. Reach out to the person. You may want to reach out to the person and offer support. Start off by offering to listen to the person. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask, \u201cAre you thinking about suicide?\u201d and \u201cWhat has led you to feel this way?\u201d Listen as the person shares their feelings with you. Comfort the person. Be kind, gentle, and supportive as you let the person know that you are there for them. Let the person know that you are concerned about them. Say, \u201cI am concerned about your safety and your life. You are important.\u201d\n\t* Tell the person you care about them and they mean something to you. For example, say, \u201cYou are important to me. I care about you.\u201d You may even want to pay them a visit if you live close to the person and know them well.\n3. Call emergency services. If a person is threatening to commit suicide, they need help. If you believe they need immediate help because they are going to commit suicide very soon, call 911 or other emergency services. Do not feel bad or embarrassed about calling for help. A threat of suicide is serious and needs to be dealt with accordingly. When you contact emergency services, tell them that the person is threatening to commit suicide via Facebook and you are concerned about their safety and life. You can also try calling a suicide prevention hotline yourself to ask for help with how to deal with the situation.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Do what you can. You may get extremely upset if you see someone you know or care about threatening to commit suicide. You should do what you can to help the person, but then let it go. Don\u2019t let yourself get inappropriately emotionally invested in the situation. You cannot control what the person does, only what you do to help. Once you have helped, there is nothing more you can do. You can check up on the person and offer support as they deal with the aftermath of the suicide threat. However, make sure to set up boundaries to protect your own mental health. Remember that you can only control your life and not the other person\u2019s. To set up boundaries, start by addressing what is in your power to do. This may be calling 911, contacting their family, or reaching out to them and listening. Next, you should do what you can. Tell yourself, \"These are the actions that are within my control to do.\" Then, remove yourself emotionally from the situation. You can only control what you do, not what they do. Remind yourself, \"I have done what I could do. I am not in control of the other person. I now will have to let it go and take care of myself.\"\n2. Refrain from being the person\u2019s counselor. You should not try to counsel the person yourself. Reaching out to the person, checking on them to gauge their mental status, and letting them know you care are important things you can do. However, you should let the professionals counsel the person. Don\u2019t try to give the person advice or convince them not to commit suicide. You are not a trained suicide counselor, so you should leave that to the professionals. You may say something to trigger a negative response or something that may upset the person\u2019s fragile emotional and mental state.\n3. Talk to a counselor. If you have helped someone who threatened suicide on Facebook, the experience may have taken an emotional toll on you. You may want to discuss your experience and feelings with a trained counselor who can help you sort through any grief, guilt, or other negative feelings. Even if the person is fine, getting involved may affect you. Instead of trying to \u201cget over it\u201d on your own, talk through the experience with someone trained in dealing with these situations. You may say to the counselor, \"I recently had someone I know threaten to commit suicide on Facebook. This really affected me. I cannot imagine the world without this person, and I keep worrying that they are going to go through with it. I know I am obsessing about this, and I need help to learn how to cope.\"\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to control chi?","response":"Chi (also known as \u201cQi\u201d and pronounced \u201cchee\u201d) is a concept that comes from Chinese medicine. Chi is life energy, which is believed to be in everything and everyone in the world. Many people wish to spend time focusing their chi because it is believe to improve health, focus, and well-being. Learning to focus your chi will be an on-going journey.\n\n## Focus chi through movement\n\n1. Practice Tai Chi. Tai Chi can help you with focusing your Chi. It is a light exercise that uses several movements and breathing to help you focus on your Chi. It is believed to help reduce stress and help with many medical conditions.\n2. Find Tai Chi classes. There are many videos for practicing Tai Chi on the web. Simply search for \u201cTai Chi videos\u201d on your favorite search engine. However, if you have never practiced any Tai Chi before, it is perhaps a good idea to visit a Tai Chi instructor to help get you started. You can also call local gyms and yoga studios to see which ones offer Tai Chi classes.\n3. Try out some of the basic movements. If you aren\u2019t sure whether you would like Tai Chi, or if you feel intimidated to go to a class, you can try out a few of the basic movements first. Begin with your feet at shoulder width. This helps you keep your weight centered. Keep in mind that when practicing Tai Chi, it is extremely important to keep you weight balanced on both of your feet, which when planted on the ground, should stay shoulder width apart. Keep your knees slightly bent. Don\u2019t lock them! Try to position yourself as if you were about to sit down into a chair, which will require your muscles in your legs to engage. Keep your spine straight, but also relaxed. Imagine that each vertebra is floating above the one below it. Touch your tongue to the roof of the mouth gently. This is believed to connect the channels which help chi flow. Thus connecting your entire body. Make a mental connection. This involves mentally thinking about connecting the wrists and ankles, elbows and knees, shoulders with hips. Become aware of your breath. Breathe in a relaxed, normal manner. Follow the inhalation and exhalation, as well as expanding and contraction of your lungs. If you can, belly breathe.\n4. Be present while practicing. Being present in the moment (rather than constantly thinking about the past or worrying about the future) plays a huge role in Eastern Philosophy. This means that when you are practicing Tai Chi (and in your daily life in general) you should also practice being mindful, or fully present, in the moment. In the case of Tai Chi, you should practice noticing physical and emotional sensations you feel while you are actively practicing. Naturally, your mind may wander. In these instance, you should simply try to notice extraneous thoughts that come into your mind, and then go back to noticing the feelings and sensations you are currently experience. Don\u2019t judge the thought, and try not to follow it.\n5. Keep practicing! The idea behind Tai Chi (and focusing and developing your Chi in general, is that you are on a journey. Thus, if you really want to use Tai Chi as a method of focusing your Chi, you should practice consistently. You may find benefit if you practice every day for a month, but you will find even more benefit if you practice a few times a week for many years.\n\n\n## Use chi breathe exercise\n\n1. Practice mindfulness when practicing these breathing exercises. The term \u201cmindfulness\u201d refers to a practice of making a gentle effort to be present in whatever you are currently doing. In this case, this means making an effort to think about the exercise as you are doing it. Think about the way the breath feels as you inhale and exhale. Although your mind will very likely wander to other thoughts, worries, and\/or other things you have to get done, just do your best to come back to the present when you notice that it has wandered. Don\u2019t get mad at yourself when this happens.\n2. Find a comfortable position. This will be different for everyone. If you find that you are comfortable sitting cross-legged on the floor, do that. If you want to lay down or even stand up, that is fine too. Make sure your clothes are comfortable, and that you are sitting with good posture. Inhale through your nose. Do this as you normally would, don\u2019t make it deeper or more shallow. Exhale slowly. Instead of out your nose, exhale out of your mouth as much as you can. Try to get all of the air out of your lungs. Breathe in through your nose. You will find this very refreshing as their was no air in your lungs, but try to breathe normally. Don\u2019t take a very deep breath, but instead take a breath as you normally would. Repeat the process of inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. Do this as many times as you like. It will help refresh you and make you more alert. However, if you feel dizzy, try taking a break or making your exhalations slower.\n3. Practice belly breathing. In Eastern medicine it is believed that breathing low in the belly is better than using the shoulders to breathe. Lie down on your back. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to do this no matter whether you are sitting, laying down, or standing. However, it\u2019s good to start in this position so you know how it should feel. Rest one of your hands low on your belly, beneath your belly button with a flat, open hand. Take a few normal breaths to relax. Take a deep breath, and then forcefully exhale. The point here is to try and push your hand up with your belly during the exhalation. Your hips and back should not move. Repeat this step until you get the hang of moving your hand using only your breathing.\n4. Breathe in a square. This may sound strange, but it will help you to experience what chi feels like. It involves breaking your inhalation and exhalation down into 4 parts. Begin by sitting in a peaceful, relaxed position. If you choose to sit up, make sure you have good posture. Take a few breaths to relax. If you have mastered belly breathing, then do that. However, if you have not, just breathe normally for a few breaths to relax. Choose an amount of time for your breaths. A good place to start is 5 seconds for inhalation and 5 seconds for exhalation. You can add or subtract time from this if you need. Breathe in for the amount of time you have chosen (i.e. 5 seconds), then spend 5 seconds without inhaling or exhaling (don\u2019t tense up your body here!). Follow this with 5 seconds of slowly exhaling, and another 5 seconds where you stop exhaling and don\u2019t inhale either. Focus on the experience of continually breathing in a square. The feeling you get from this is chi.\n\n\n## Focus chi through meditation\n\n1. Search for videos or apps. If you have never practiced meditation before, you can search the web for videos or for apps for your smart phone that can guide you through a meditation session. If you choose to use a video to guide you, skim through several videos to see if you enjoy the tempo of the guidance, the length, and the content of the guidance. You don\u2019t have to listen to the whole thing before you start, but try to look for a guided meditation for beginners as these will be much shorter and include much more verbal guidance.\n2. Avoid eating for at least half an hour before meditating. A full belly can make you sleepy and weigh you down. When meditating, you want to be awake, but relaxed.\n3. Find a quiet place to meditate. If you can find a nearly silent place to meditate, this is best. If you wish, you can use music to help you focus in your meditation. However, be sure to use music that is suitable for Chi meditation. If you don\u2019t have any such music, you can search sites like YouTube for videos that play the correct music. Simply search for \u201cChi meditation music\u201d (or try \u201cQi meditation music\u201d), and you should find suitable music.\n4. Find a comfortable, seated position. If you can, sit cross-legged on the floor. If this is not possible for you, sit upright in a chair with your feet planted flat on the floor.\n5. Rest your hands lightly on your lap. Your hands should rest with your palms facing upwards either on each leg or with your left hand cradling your right hand just below your navel. If you choose the latter, have your thumbs gently touching each other.\n6. Keep your spine straight. This can be challenging at first, but try not to slouch. Instead, practice sitting with your spine straight. While you should try to keep your spine straight, you should not feel tense. Thus, try to keep a straight, but relaxed position.\n7. Relax your gaze. You can choose to gently close your eyes, or keep your eyes open. Either way, begin by resting your gaze in front of you, not focusing too hard on anything in particular.\n8. Become aware of your physical and emotional feelings. Notice the way your body feels as it rests on the floor or chair, and take note of the thoughts and emotions you are feeling at this moment.\n9. Become aware of your breathing. Notice your breathe. Notice the way it feels as you inhale in through the nose (e.g. Is the air cold? Is one nostril more open than the other?) and then notice how it feels as you exhale (e.g. Is the air warmer? Does the air come out slowly or forcefully?). As you breathe in, imagine that you are breathing in good energy. As you breathe out, imagine that you are breathing out toxins and bad energy.\n10. Practice meditation every single day. With meditation it is best to practice every day if at all possible. This may mean that you have to reduce the time that you meditate, which is OK. It is better to meditate for 10 minutes each day than for 30 or 40 minutes only once per week.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Chi is pronounced

{"instruction":"How to cite a website?","response":"## Mla\n\n1. Start your Works Cited entry with the author's name, if provided. If an individual author is listed for the web page you want to cite, type their last name first, followed by a comma, then their first name. Place a period at the end of the name. Example: Claymore, Crystal. If no individual author is listed, but the website is produced by a government agency, organization, or business, use that name as the author. For example, if you're using a CDC web page as a source, you would list the author as \"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Tip: For your entire Works Cited entry, if an element doesn't exist or isn't provided, simply skip that part of the citation and move on to the next part.\n2. Provide the title of the page in double quotation marks. If the specific web page has a title, type it after the author's name. Use title case, capitalizing the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adverbs, adjectives, and verbs. Enclose the title in double quotation marks, placing a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\"\n3. Give the name of the website in italics followed by the date of publication. Type the name of the website as a whole in title case, followed by a comma. Use the capitalization and spacing schemes the website uses if they are proprietary (such as \"wikiHow\" or \"WebMD\") If there is a publication date for the web page, list it in day-month-year format, abbreviating all months with names longer than 4 letters. Place a comma after the date of publication. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, 24 Sept. 2018,\n4. Include the URL for the web page. Copy the URL for the web page and paste it into your entry, leaving off the \"http:\/\/\" part. Place a period at the end of the URL. Make sure the URL you use is a permalink for the information you're citing. If the URL is excessively long, talk to your instructor or supervisor about using a shortened URL. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, 24 Sept. 2018, www.crystalscupcakes.com\/amazing-frosting.\n5. Close with your date of access if there was no date of publication. Often, a web page won't have a particular publication date. If that happens for a page you want to cite, add the word \"Accessed\" after the URL and include the date you last accessed the page in day-month-year format. Abbreviate all months with names that have more than 4 letters. Place a period at the end of the date. Example: Claymore, Crystal. \"Best-Kept Secrets for Amazing Cupcake Frosting.\" Crystal's Cupcakes, www.crystalscupcakes.com\/amazing-frosting. Accessed 14 Feb. 2019. MLA Works Cited Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Web Page in Title Case.\" Name of Website, Day Month Year of publication, URL. Accessed Day Month Year.\n6. Place a parenthetical citation after referencing the website in your text. An MLA parenthetical citation typically includes the author's last name and the page number where the quoted or paraphrased information can be found. Since websites don't have page numbers, simply include the author's last name in the parenthetical, or the title of the web page if there is no author. Place your parenthetical inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. For example, you might write: \"The best cupcake frosting techniques are often the least intuitive (Claymore).\" If you include the author's name in your text, there's no need for a parenthetical citation. For example, you might write: \"Award-winning baker Crystal Claymore wasn't afraid to give away all her secrets, sharing her favorite frosting techniques on her website.\"\n\n\n## Apa\n\n1. Start your reference list entry with the name of the author. If an individual author is listed, type their last name first, followed by a comma, then their first and middle initials (if a middle initial is given. Usually, the author of a website will be the government agency, organization, or business that owns the website. In that case, list the name of that entity followed by a period. Example: Canadian Cancer Society.\n2. Add the year the website or page was published. If a publication date is provided next to the content you are citing, include that year in parentheses after the name of the author. Place a period after the closing parentheses. If no date is provided for the specific content you're citing, use the abbreviation \"n.d.\" (for \"no date\") inside the parentheses. Do not use the copyright date for the website itself. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). If you're citing several pages from the same website that were published in the same year, add a lower-case letter to the end of the year so you can differentiate them in your in-text citations. For example, you might have \"2017a\" and \"2017b.\"\n3. Type the title of the web page in sentence case. Type a space after the period that follows the date, then type the title of the web page, which will usually appear as a header at the top of the page. Use sentence case, capitalizing only the first word and any proper nouns. Place a period at the end of the title. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). Cancer research. If the content you're citing is a stand-alone document, the title should be italicized. This will usually be the case if you're citing a PDF document that appears on a website. If you're not sure, use your best judgment in deciding whether to italicize it or not.\n4. Close with the direct URL of the web page. Copy the full direct URL or permalink of the content you want to cite. Type the words \"Retrieved from,\" then past the URL into your entry. Do not place a period at the end of the URL. If the URL is overly long, ask your instructor or supervisor if you can use a shortened link. Example: Canadian Cancer Society. (2017). Cancer research. Retrieved from http:\/\/www.cancer.ca\/en\/cancer-information\/cancer-101\/cancer-research\/?region=on\n\t* APA Reference List Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, A. A. (Year). Title of web page in sentence case. Retrieved from URL\n5. Use the author's name and year for in-text parenthetical citations. APA uses author-year parenthetical at the end of any sentence in which you quote or paraphrase information from the website. The parenthetical citation goes inside the closing punctuation for the sentence. For example, you might write: \"Clinical trials are used to test new cancer treatments (Canadian Cancer Society, 2017).\" If you include the author's name in your text, place the year in parentheses immediately after the author's name. For example, you might write: \"The Canadian Cancer Society (2017) noted that Canada is a global leader in clinical trials of cancer treatments.\"\n\n\n## Chicago\n\n1. Start your bibliographic entry with the name of the author. If the web page has an individual author listed, type that author's last name first, followed by a comma, then their first name. If there is no individual author, use the name of the organization, company, or government agency that published the content as the author. Place a period at the end of the author's name. Example: UN Women.\n2. List the title of the web page in double quotation marks. After the name of the article, provide the title of the specific web page. Use title case, capitalizing the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs. Place a period at the end of the title, inside the closing quotation marks. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\"\n3. Add the name of the website or publishing organization in italics. If the website has a distinct name, include this after the title of the webpage. If it doesn't, use the name of the business, organization, or government agency that produces the website. Place a period at the end of the name. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women.\n4. Provide the publication date or access date. If the content you're citing has a specific publication date associated with it, provide that date in month-day-year format. If no publication date is listed, type the word \"Accessed\" followed by the date you accessed the content in month-day-year format. Spell out the names of all months. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women. Accessed February 14, 2019.\n5. Close your entry with a direct URL to the web page. Copy the full URL for the permalink of the web page and paste it into your bibliographic entry. Place a period at the end of the URL. If the URL is overly lengthy, talk to your instructor, editor, or supervisor about using a shortened link. Example: UN Women. \"Commission on the Status of Women.\" UN Women. Accessed February 14, 2019. http:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/csw. Chicago Bibliography Format:\n\t* Author Last Name, First Name. \"Title of Web Page in Title Case.\" Name of Website or Publishing Organization. Accessed Month Day, Year. URL.\n6. Use commas instead of periods between elements in footnotes. A Chicago-style footnote generally includes all of the same information as the bibliographic entry. However, the footnote is treated as a sentence, with elements separated by commas. If there was an individual author listed, their name should be listed with their first name first, followed by their last name, just as you would do it if you wrote it in text. Example: UN Women, \"Commission on the Status of Women,\" UN Women, accessed February 14, 2019, http:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/csw.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to help first graders with spelling words?","response":"Helping a first grader learn to spell can be both challenging and rewarding. Whether you're a teacher, a parent, a grandparent or a volunteer, there are ways to help a child with spelling words. The best strategies to encourage a young speller are based in knowing more about a child's spelling ability, and the early stages of writing.\n\n## Teach spell strategies\n\n1. Assess students' spelling knowledge. The best teaching practice starts with learning what the student already knows. Take a moment to check the students' knowledge of spelling by asking them to spell a list of common first grade words. Assessment allows you to start teaching at the area of your students' competence. Words found at the first grade level are short, 1-4 letters long. They are 1 syllable words. Examples of first grade words are: a, to, at, boy, bad, dip, cat, nest, sand, play. Assessment continues by analyzing students' independent writing. Provide opportunities for your students to write, whether in art projects or academic activities. Continue assessing throughout the school year. Ongoing assessment is vital for effective teaching practice.\n2. Teach in small groups. Most teachers are aware of the disparity between their students' abilities and know that small group instruction is preferred when possible. In helping first graders with spelling, it's essential to teach in small groups. Group assignments should be based on what you've discovered through your spelling assessments, so that students of similar spelling abilities can be taught at the same time. Be aware that some students' reading and their spelling abilities may be quite different. Don't base spelling assessments on students' ability to read. Have other students engage in word-related activities at their seats, or participate in literacy activities in the classroom's centers, will help you manage the other students while working with small groups. Having an assistant or a classroom volunteer can be helpful to managing the small groups of students.\n3. Prioritize spelling instruction. You'll need to find the time to assess and teach spelling to your first graders. This can be difficult to manage, because it requires individualization to the child's learning ability. Plan ahead to include spelling instruction every day, multiple times per day. Consider creating inclusion of spelling words in different areas of study. Invest a little time every day in independent word work and individual or small group instruction.\n4. Teach word knowledge, not just spelling. Teaching sight words, words that the student is likely to encounter often, helps the first grader with spelling. Post familiar words around the classroom. Teach students to consider why the word is spelled as it is. Teach the rules behind the spelling. For example, teach the reason for the silent e, and how it affects the sound of the word. Adding an e to a simple 3-letter word usually makes the vowel long, rather than short. Teach sight words that don't usually fit the standard first-grade curriculum, if you find the students' using these words frequently. Post these words around your classroom, and refer to them when they naturally arise in other teaching. These sight words might include: because, are, again, said, friend, were.\n5. Demonstrate usefulness of spelling. Students will be more motivated to learn to spell if they understand its importance. A first-grader must be taught the connection between reading words and proper spelling. By teaching students to recognize the power spelling has over understanding, you'll help them transfer their spelling knowledge into other activities of their life. Group activities can have multiple fill-in-the-blank opportunities. Mad Libs is a great activity for teaching spelling. Teacher scaffolding can help support beginning learners. Reminding the student what she already knows, strategies she might try to complete a spelling word, and providing hints and encouragement all support a first grader with spelling.\n6. Integrate strategies for independent spelling. When you're helping your first graders, say each word you want them to spell slowly. Teach your first graders to listen for the sounds they hear (initial sound, middle sound, final sound). Help them identify any part they might know, e.g., br in brought. Encourage students to notice how words come together to make a larger word. For example, putting fun and silly together to make funny. Students might enjoy clapping the syllables, then writing letters for each syllable. Help the students identify different spellings of rhyming words, such as space and place, or here and there. Students need lots of opportunities to try the correct spelling to see if it looks right. Provide resources around the classroom - dictionaries, calendars, charts, word walls, etc.\n7. Encourage all writing, regardless of spelling. Writing and spelling are two different academic areas. Having students write, without worrying about their spelling, will help them become more confident writers and spellers. Provide opportunities for students to write about things that are important to them: football games, video games, school outings, or pets are popular topics. These learning opportunities are found throughout the students' day. Make games out of writing about new topics.\n8. Expose students to written words. The more a child is exposed to written words, the more likely he is to internalize the spelling of the word. If you're working on particular spelling words, point them out in books, magazines and online. Highlight with a marker to emphasize that the word he's learning is also found in the \"real world\" if possible. Students may enjoy \"proofreading\" for spelling mistakes. First graders may appreciate reading the same stories over and over again. If this is the case, take advantage of this repetition to highlight different words found within the same story.\n\n\n## Recognize the early stag of write\n\n1. Know the signs of the pre-communicative writing stage. A first grade child may be still at the pre-communicative stage of writing, which means that he only has a rough idea of the alphabet. Your first grader may recognize different letters of the alphabet, but be unaware of words as a visual construct. Spaces between words may not be noticed. For children in this stage, continue to teach alphabet shapes and expose the child to written words through reading aloud with him. Never attempt to correct the spelling of a child at this stage of writing.\n2. Learn about the semiphonetic stage of writing. By first grade, some children will be at the semiphonetic stage of reading. A this stage, the child is making a connection between the sound of the word and the sound of a letter or two within the word. He may dramatically abbreviate the word, such as using T or D for dog. The word that the child may attempt to spell first may be his name, or the M for Mom or D for Dad. Children's ability to segment, or separate, the distinct sounds of a word may be still emerging. Encourage a child to write often, no matter how difficult the word may be to read. Don't worry about spelling at this stage, but provide help if the child is open.\n3. Know about the phonetic spelling stage. This is a common stage for first graders, a stage of spelling that assumes basic knowledge of the alphabet and understand that words and sounds are connected. A speller at this stage may use \"invented\" spelling patterns based on the sound of the word.Children at this level will be more interested in learning correct spelling. Provide models of correctly spelled words, and start to encourage them to think about how to spell words for themselves. This is a wonderful stage to start to help a child with spelling. Examples of invented spellings might be kam for came, wel for will, fes for fish, etc. Another thing you might notice is that the child starts to recognize beginning patterns in words, noticing rhymes and similar sounds.\n4. Learn more about the transitional spelling stage. A few first graders might already be at the transitional stage of spelling. At this stage, the student will have emerging reading skills and recognize many words. They begin to understand that sounds are represented by letter combinations, and that words can be made plural or altered in other ways by suffixes and prefixes. Being patient with mistakes at this stage is essential. The words might actually be more difficult to understand than with a phonetic speller, but the child's spelling mistakes are based in an inadequate understanding of spelling patterns. Continue to teach the patterns that make for good spelling. Teach the child how to laugh at spelling inconsistencies as are so often found in the English language. Reminders of appropriate spelling can also be taught at this stage, such as \"I before E, except after C, unless it's an A as in neighbor or weigh.\"\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to be cool in college?","response":"Congratulations, you\u2019re in college! If you feel anxious at all about college life, know that you are not alone. To gain instant respect from your fellow classmates and friends, remember to always be yourself. Being friendly and acting confidently are also ways you can earn some cool points among your friends and classmates.\n\n## Reinvent yourself in college\n\n1. List the things you want to change about yourself. Grab a sheet of paper and draw a line down the middle. List the things that you would like to change about yourself in the left column. In the right column write down why you would like to change these things. If after asking why you see that making these changes leads to a better you, then change it. For example, wanting to be less critical of others, or more focused in class are positive changes.\n2. Try something new. College is all about exploring new things and ideas, so be adventurous. When you get the invite to go eat at an exotic restaurant, take it. Studying abroad for one year is another great way to expand your horizons. Try changing your hair color, or style your hair differently. You could also learn a new language, or take a class outside of your major.\n3. Remember to be yourself. It is possible to re-invent yourself without changing your true self. Don't throw out your morals and values just to be considered cool. If the change takes too much effort or requires you to be someone else, then it probably isn't a good change. Stick to changes that produce positive results. If you want to be more outgoing, then be more outgoing on your own terms. Don't start drinking or smoking just to be more outgoing, for example.\n\n\n## Boost your confidence\n\n1. Make a list of your strengths. Also make a list of the things that you like about yourself. Tape the list to your bedroom wall or bathroom mirror. Every morning, read the list to remind yourself of how great you are.\n2. Reverse negative thoughts. If you find yourself thinking that you aren't good enough for college or that no one will want to be friends with you, then reverse these thoughts. Instead, tell yourself, \"I am good enough for college,\" or \"Many people would love to be friends with me because I am a great friend.\"\n3. Do the things that make you feel confident. If wearing makeup helps you feel more confident, then wear makeup. If smiling and greeting your classmates makes you feel more confident, then greet them. If joining a club or volunteering helps you feel more confident, then join a club or volunteer. By doing the things that help you feel more confident, you will be more confident.\n4. Realize that you are not alone. New people and places can make you feel alone and unsure at times. However, understand that you aren't the only one who feels this way. Try to reach out and befriend other classmates, or call your high school friends if you need someone to talk to. If you cannot seem to shake your loneliness, make an appointment with a counselor on campus. A counselor can help you work through hard times.\n\n\n## Be social\n\n1. Portray a friendly attitude. Smile and say hi to your classmates sitting next you. Strike up a conversation by asking them what their major is or what they think about the class. Offering help, like showing someone where the admissions office is, is also a great way to become known as a friendly, down-to-earth person in college. You could also offer to trade notes with someone, or help someone study for a big test.\n2. Be accepting those who are different from you. A typical college has at least 20,000 students, (smaller colleges and community colleges might have anywhere from 2,000-10,000 students) so you are bound to run into someone whose background is completely different from yours. Instead of shying away from them, be curious about who they are. Invite them to lunch or a party to get to know them better.\n3. Attend a football game (or any other sporting event). Tailgating with friends and attending a football game (or any other sporting event) afterward is a college pastime you won\u2019t want to pass up. Go to as many of these as you can, especially if you enjoy them. It is a great way to connect with new people and cultivate friendships. Ask a classmate if they would like to go to a game, or make plans with your roommate to attend a game.\n4. Join a club on campus. If football games or Greek life isn\u2019t your thing, try looking into different clubs on campus. Like sororities and fraternities, they typically host events in the beginning of the year to recruit new members. Attend some of these and join your favorite ones. There are so many clubs in college, the hardest part will be picking one. You can also start a club as well.\n5. Host a party. Hosting a party will definitely shoot you up to the top of the cool list. Have a potluck, plan an outdoor party at a nearby park, or reserve a party room at your college\u2019s game center. Invite your friends, roommates, and acquaintances from class. You could also have a small party in your dorm room, if it is allowed. To ensure your party\u2019s success, make sure to provide some snacks and beverages, cool tunes, and games.\n\n\n## Dress for college\n\n1. Put yourself together before class. Before going to class, make sure to brush your teeth and comb your hair. Also shower if you need to. By taking the time to groom yourself before class, you can give your classmates and professors a good impression of yourself.\n2. Choose sneakers over heels. Going from class to class requires a lot of walking. By wearing sneakers, you can ensure that your feet will be as comfortable as possible. . Some classes will require you to wear certain footwear for practical or safety reasons, especially if you are in some hands-on classes or a PE class. Your instructor\/professor will inform you in the syllabus.\n3. Carry a jacket with you. Unlike high school, colleges usually don't have locker areas so you will be wearing or carrying a jacket during the winter season in colder climates. Classroom temperatures typically run very cold to sometimes very hot. Since it is hard to concentrate in class if you are cold, make sure to bring a jacket or a sweater with you. This way you can ensure that you will be comfortable and attentive in class.. People will be paying more attention to your outerwear as part of your look in college than in high school; so, make sure the outerwear you choose matches your preferred look.\n4. Dress with style. Arrive to class in an outfit that makes you feel comfortable, but also one that sends a message of sophistication and style. If casual athletic gear is your style, then wear that.

It is equally important to be able to identify different forklifts, both by look and name. This is especially important when searching for forklift operating jobs, as it will allow you to know which type of forklift you will be operating and if you have the experience to do so.\n\n## Identify basic \"forklifts\" and jack\n\n1. Know what manual pallet jacks are. Although not usually considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries. Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised by pumping the handle.\n2. Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks. Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries. Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on\/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.\n3. Learn to recognize walkie stackers. Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are still usually not considered a true forklift. However, they very closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms, small scale warehousing, etc.\n\n\n## Identify counterbalance forklifts\n\n1. Know what standard counterbalance forklifts are. Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift.\n2. Consider how different standard counterbalance forklifts are powered. These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG\/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric\/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.\n3. Be familiar with how many wheels standard counterbalance forklifts have. They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces.\n\n\n## Identify warehouse forklifts\n\n1. Get to know reach forklifts. Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high racking. (up to 12 metres (39ft) or more!!!) Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type. Reach forklifts generally have lifting capacities of 1 ton to 2.5 tons. Lifting capacities above 2.5 ton are generally very rare due to many factors such as narrow aisle space and keeping the forklift compact (a stronger forklift must be larger and therefore unable to operate in narrow aisles) and also generally due to most loads in warehousing to be put in aisle racking usually just do not weigh more than 1- 2 tons. Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift. Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.\n2. Know what double deep reach forklifts are. Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve\/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks.\n3. Familiarize yourself with order picker forklifts. Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness and stand while operating, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator then typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet to \"pick\" an warehouse order; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air.\n4. Recognize the disadvantages of picker forklifts. The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of tip overs.\n\n\n## Identify big forklifts\n\n1. Know what a heavy duty forklift is. A heavy duty forklift is an umbrella term used to describe a counterbalance forklift with a high lifting capacity. Most standard counterbalance forklifts in warehouses and manufacturing plants will only have a lifting capacity of 1-3 tons, whereas heavy duty forklifts have a lifting capacity of 5 - 50+ tons!\n2. Understand how heavy duty forklifts operate. All heavy duty forklifts will require significant space to be able to maneuver around. The higher the lifting capacity the forklift has, the larger the rear end (counterweight) of the forklift will need to be. The vast majority of heavy duty forklifts will be powered by diesel fuel, though some lower end heavy duty forklifts (with lifting capacities up to 8-10 tons) may still be powered by LPG\/propane gas bottles or petrol fuel.While It is generally very uncommon to encounter battery powered heavy duty forklifts, a few forklift companies have recently started to offer them up to the 20 ton range.\n3. Learn about container handling forklifts. Container handling forklifts generally come in two types: Laden and Unladen (i.e. for handling full or empty containers, respectively). Laden container handling forklifts are usually capable of stacking full shipping containers 4-5 high, with lifting capacities ranging from 35-50 tons. Unladen container handling forklifts are able to stack as high as 8 or 9 shipping containers high, but with a lifting capacity of only 7-10 tons (empty shipping containers generally only weigh 3-5 tons). For these reasons, an unladen container handling forklift cannot be used for handling laden shipping containers, as it will be extremely overloaded. (full shipping containers can weigh anywhere from 10-30 tons).\n4. Learn about reach stackers. Reach stackers are technically not forklifts at all; as they do not have a mast or forks to lift loads, instead, they operate with a heavy duty boom that extends from the rear to the front of the reach stacker, and they lift shipping containers using a container handling attachment. Reach stackers often are highly sophisticated machines with on-board computers and other technologies. Their load capacity usually ranges from 40-50 tons. However, due to the extending boom feature, overloading is still possible.\n\n\n## Identify specialist forklifts\n\n1. Learn about Articulated VNA Forklifts. Pictured here, Articulated VNA (Very Narrow Aisle) Forklifts are generally known as \"Bendi\" or \"Flexi\" Forklifts. Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks and carriage) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve\/put away stock in narrow aisles). Another variation of the articulated forklift is the \"Turret truck\" also known as the \"Man-up forklift\", named so, as much like an order picker forklift, turret truck forklifts lift the operator high up in the air along with the forks. Much like \"bendi\" articulated forklifts, turret trucks allow for maximized warehouse storage space by greatly reducing the aisle widths - however unlike bendi forklifts, turret trucks cannot be operated outside, on slopes or on uneven ground, similar as order picking forklifts.\n2. Identify an all terrain forklift. Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is All terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - they would have no traction and get \"bogged\". All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor.\n3. Learn about side loaders. A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads.\n4. Learn about telehandler forklifts. Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a large trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be significantly reduced.\n5. Understand truck mounted forklifts. Truck mounted forklifts, also known as \"donkey forklifts\", are just as their name suggests. They are a small type of forklift that can be easily mounted on the back of a truck for transport, and easily taken off for use of loading or unloading the trucks on-site. These forklifts are generally built to be lightweight and very simple to operate, thus lifting capacities and lift heights are generally very low. Essentially they are used for lifting small loads on and off trucks, unless they are otherwise specially designed to perform other functions.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to read gel electrophoresis bands?","response":"## View your sample\n\n1. Hold a UV light up to the gel sheet to reveal results. With your gel sheet in front of you, find the switch on a tube of UV light to turn it on. Hold the UV light 8\u201316 inches (20\u201341 cm) away from the gel sheet. illuminate the DNA samples with the UV light to activate the gel and read the results. If the test was performed properly, your sheet should have 2-8 sets of vertical stripes in parallel rows.Warning: Wear gloves and protective eyewear when physically handling a gel sample. Touching the gel can interfere with your results and some of the gels are harmful if they get in your eyes. Place the gel sheet on a piece of wax paper if you\u2019re removing it from the machine. The individual stripes indicate specific strands of DNA. The strips should have varying levels of thickness. If you\u2019re reading results that have been printed on a sheet of paper, you can skip this step.\n2. Find the wells by looking for the biggest pools of color. To properly orient yourself, you need to find the original location of the samples, called the wells. With your sheet in front of you, look for the end of the sheet with a big pool of colored gel. The wells are the locations where the gel samples are loaded into the sheet and indicate the start of the sample.There should be one well for each of your samples. If one of the wells is lacking color, the sample may have been applied poorly. The wells indicate the negative end of the sheet. The opposite side of the sheet is the positive end. When each sample is applied to the sheet, the negatively-charged DNA travels across the sheet to the opposite side, leaving individual samples of DNA behind as it moves.\n3. Classify each strip by noting the origin of the samples. If you\u2019ve been given a key, understand that each horizontal row depicts a unique set of DNA. Use your key to determine what each row represents. The number of samples can be determined by counting the number of rows. If you haven\u2019t been given a key, you cannot determine the source of each sample. Electrophoresis only provides you with information about a DNA sample\u2019s behavior, but it doesn\u2019t reveal the source of a sample on its own.If you performed the test yourself, write down where each row\u2019s sample is from while you\u2019re applying the gel.\n4. Identify the DNA ladder to establish a scale for the DNA. Depending on whether or not a DNA ladder was included in the test, you may have one strip designed to provide you with a scale to make comparisons easier. This scale is called the DNA ladder. The DNA ladder will contain strips of DNA of known sizes to make it easier to figure out how big or small the other strips are.Actual DNA samples will have a lot of variation in the sequence of the strips. There may be a few thin strips, followed by 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of empty space, followed by thick strips, and ending in more thin strips. The DNA ladder will make it easier to figure out how big the individual strips actually are by giving you something to compare them to. The DNA ladder is almost always placed in the last row at the top or bottom of your sheet.\n\n\n## Assess the size of the sample\n\n1. Identify thinner strips to find the faster DNA molecules. When each sample is applied, it starts moving to the positive end of the sheet on the right. The smaller the molecules are, the faster they move since they experience less resistance. A smaller and faster DNA sample leaves thinner strips behind as it moves. When looking at your results, determine which DNA samples are smaller and faster by looking for the thinnest strips.\n2. Find the thicker strips to find the slower DNA. Samples with larger molecules naturally move slower through the gel. As a result, you can find the bigger or slower molecules by looking for the biggest strips on your page. Looking at the frequency of the bigger and smaller strips as they appear in a single row you a good picture of the sample\u2019s DNA fingerprint.The way individual strips are arranged in a sequence is unique to each genetic sample. The combination of thin and thick strips creates a specific picture of someone\u2019s genetic makeup. DNA isn\u2019t stronger or better if it leaves thicker bands behind. These strips are simply identifying markers that you can use to compare a variety of samples.\n3. Use the DNA ladder to determine the size of each strip. The DNA ladder is used to give you a scale to compare the individual strips to. The size of the strips in a DNA ladder depend upon the type of ladder that was used for the test, but it will typically be either 10-100 bp (base pairs), or 500-1000 bp. The thickest strip is the highest size in a spectrum and the smallest size is the lowest. So for a 10-100 bp ladder, the thickest strip is 100 bp, and the thinnest strip is 10 bp.Tip: The range of a DNA ladder is printed on the bottle that the ladder came in. It may also be listed on the key if you were given one. There is no way to determine the range of a ladder based on the strip alone, since different gels will allow samples to travel at different speeds. 1000 bp is the same as 1 kb. Kb is short for kilobase, and the ladder may use this unit instead of bp. The smaller the scale is, the more accurate the comparisons will be. Base pairs and kilobases are simply units of measurement. They refer to the physical size of a DNA molecule.\n\n\n## Make conclusions\n\n1. Look for strips that appear at the same point on the sheet to find similarities. When looking at the sheet holistically, look for points where 2 or more strips appear in identical locations on different rows. This is an indicator that the DNA samples are somehow related. If there are 2 or more rows without any overlap in the sequence, they are entirely unrelated. The more related 2 samples are, the more overlap there will be in their sequences.In other words, if you\u2019re looking at the sheet with the wells on the left, you\u2019re looking for vertical columns where 2 strips appear at the same time. For example, a mother and her child will have half of their strips overlapping. A child and their second cousins though may only have 2-3 strips that overlap.\n2. Identify identical samples by finding strips with the same configuration. If 2 or more samples have a nearly identical sequence of strips, they\u2019re the same DNA. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the source of the sample is the same\u2014identical twins, for example, will have the same DNA sequence on an electrophoresis sheet. Identical strips are usually required to reasonably tie a suspect to a crime scene.Tip: Electrophoresis is often used by forensics teams to rule out suspects in criminal cases. It is also used to test maternity or paternity.\n3. Understand the limitations of electrophoresis testing. Electrophoresis testing is helpful when it comes to comparing DNA samples, but it can be hard to make definitive conclusions sometimes. The scale can only get so magnified, and smearing can make bands hard to interpret. In some instances, you won\u2019t be able to conclusively say that 2 samples are related.More than 2 overlapping bands indicates a strong similarity between 2 samples. When assessing results, scientists will often say that there is a \u201chigh probability\u201d that 2 samples are related if less than half of the bands in 2 samples overlap.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You have a gel sheet in front of you.","max_prob":11.4787130356,"ccp":-0.063542258},{"claim":"There is

{"instruction":"How to lessen the pressure of life?","response":"## Reduce the pressure of life\n\n1. Start a stress journal to identify and reflect on the sources of pressure in your life. Are you experiencing financial pressure? Are you experiencing stresses at a new job or as a result of a job loss? A stress journal can help you identify the most significant sources of stress in your life and how you cope with them. This self knowledge will help you tackle the biggest stressors in your life. You can also reflect on the specific situations within which you experience higher stress levels. Do you experience more stress at particular times of the week or in particular spaces (e.g., a conference room) at work? Are there ways of avoiding such situations entirely, or responding more effectively to them? Reflect on these kinds of questions and work towards insights on how to manage stress through journaling. Create a list of everything you are grateful for in your life. Recognizing the good things in your life can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n2. Take a stress assessment test. There may be stressors that are so normal in your life that you don't even realize they're stressing you out. A stress assessment test can help you identify these hidden stressors. There are many online tests that you can do. You can take a free stress assessment test online at https:\/\/www.stress.org\/self-assessment\/.\n3. Make a plan to tackle the sources of pressure in your life. Utilizing the information from your stress journal, you may decide that you need a revised financial plan, a personal health plan or a work plan. The most important thing is to tackle the sources of pressure through a purposeful and detailed plan of action. Talk to your supervisor to create a plan of action to reduce the stressors you experience at work. Make a financial plan with specific targets, including not only long term savings or retirement goals but also near term goals that are concrete and achievable. Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, \u201cI can overcome this hurdle\u201d\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to treat a hernia at home?","response":"## Reduce and manage pain\n\n1. Take over-the-counter pain meds to help relieve your discomfort. Aspirin and ibuprofen may work well to alleviate some pain and swelling. Follow the recommended dosage on the bottle and don\u2019t exceed the daily limit. If you find your pain doesn\u2019t get better or if you keep taking more and more medication, it may be time to call your doctor. If you take a blood thinner, always check with your doctor before using pain medication. They may want you to take something different so it doesn\u2019t interfere with the blood thinner. Types of Hernias: Almost all hernias will eventually need to be treated through surgery, especially if they\u2019re bulging or causing you a lot of pain. Some of the more common types of hernias include:\n\t* Inguinal hernia: This type of hernia is in the groin area; it most often affects men, though women can experience it, too. Femoral hernia: This hernia is located around the top of your inner thigh, caused by part of your intestines pushing through your groin. These are most common among older women. Hiatal hernia: This hernia appears on your abdomen as part of your stomach protrudes into your chest cavity. Umbilical hernia: This occurs when tissue pushes through your abdomen near your belly button. It can affect both infants and adults.\n2. Avoid heartburn-causing foods and large meals if you have a hiatal hernia. This is the one type of hernia that sometimes doesn\u2019t need surgery, especially if its symptoms can be managed through diet and over-the-counter antacids. If your symptoms increase over time, though, surgery may become the best solution.Enjoy multiple small meals throughout the day instead of 3 larger ones. This will put less pressure on your stomach so you\u2019re more comfortable all day long. Avoid caffeine, chocolate, garlic, tomatoes, and other fatty or fried foods that can cause heartburn. Don\u2019t lay down after you eat for several hours.\n3. Relieve discomfort from an inguinal hernia with a truss. A truss is a supportive undergarment that helps keep your hernia in place\u2014it\u2019s a temporary solution to help relieve pain until you can have surgery. You can buy a truss online, but it\u2019s best to visit your doctor so they can make sure it\u2019s properly fitted. Most inguinal hernias do need surgery to be repaired, but if your hernia is really small and not causing you pain, your doctor may be okay with waiting and keeping an eye on it. Surgery may sound scary, but these procedures usually take less than an hour and should quickly help relieve your pain.\n4. Eat a fiber-rich diet to make bowel movements softer and easier to pass. Straining your muscles can aggravate your hernia, and constipation can make things worse. Add lots of fruits and vegetables to your daily diet, and consider taking a fiber supplement to help things move smoothly.Oatmeal, nuts, beans, popcorn, chia seeds, and whole grains are also great high-fiber food choices.\n5. Lose weight to take pressure off of your abdomen. This can be helpful for all types of hernias; the less weight you\u2019re carrying around, the less strain your muscles will be under. Try modifying your diet by eating leaner proteins and more fruits and vegetables, and try adding in some gentle exercise every day to lose weight.Hernias can be really uncomfortable and it may be hard for you to imagine exercising. Try going for short 15-minute walks when you can, or go to the pool and slowly swim laps. Be gentle on yourself, though, so you don\u2019t aggravate the hernia more.\n\n\n## Prevent further damage\n\n1. Avoid lifting bulky or heavy objects that may strain your muscles. Instead of bending over at the waist to pick up heavy items, bend your knees so you\u2019re squatting. Bring the object close to you and then straighten your legs and stand up. Keep the heavy object at chest level and try not to twist and turn too much.For heavy items you can\u2019t lift yourself, consider using a dolly. You wedge the bottom of the dolly under the item, then use your weight to pull on the dolly\u2019s handle to lift the object. From there, you can wheel it wherever it needs to go.\n2. Relax while going to the bathroom so you don\u2019t strain your groin area. This is a little counterintuitive, but try to not strain when you have a bowel movement. Take your time and don\u2019t push too hard; instead, let your body slowly work things out\u2014it may take longer than usual, but it\u2019s gentler on your body and can prevent further damage.A high-fiber diet can help prevent hernias as well as manage discomfort if you already have one. Putting your feet up on a short stool may also make those muscles relax and help you go to the bathroom more easily. Add a hot cup of coffee to your morning routine. The heat and caffeine can help things get moving.\n3. Strengthen your abdominal muscles to prevent additional hernias. Weak muscles make it easier for your internal organs to break through your abdominal walls. The key to strengthening your core is to do so gently\u2014too much pressure or exertion could actually cause a hernia, so start slow and stop any exercises that cause you pain. Try doing 3 sets of 10 mini crunches every day. Lay on your back with your knees bent and put your hands behind your head. Use your ab muscles to bring your shoulders up off the ground 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102 mm) before carefully lowering yourself back to the ground. Workout at the pool for low-resistance strength training. The support of the water will make it easier for you to exercise without having to strain your abdominals as much. Start slow if you\u2019re new to swimming or doing water exercises, and enjoy your time in the water! Take a beginner\u2019s yoga class to gently stretch and tone your core.\n4. Quit smoking to improve lung health and eliminate excessive coughing. There are lots of reasons to quit smoking, and doing so can also help prevent hernias. Chronic coughing strains your muscles in both your abdomen and groin, so start curbing your smoking habit or quit cold turkey. It can be extremely hard to stop smoking. If you\u2019re having a hard time, talk to your doctor. They may be able to provide you with some kind of aid to help make the transition easier.\n\n\n## Seek medical care\n\n1. See your doctor for an official diagnosis before treating yourself. You will likely recognize the signs and symptoms of a hernia on your own, especially if it\u2019s large. However, it\u2019s easy to misdiagnose yourself, so see your doctor to make sure what you have is a hernia. Your doctor will make a proper diagnosis so you can be sure you\u2019re getting the right treatment.Your doctor will do a physical examination to check for a hernia. They\u2019ll look at the area and may press into it with their hands. In some cases, your doctor may do imaging tests to view the hernia.\n2. Talk with your child\u2019s pediatrician if they develop an umbilical hernia. For infants and children under 5, always check with your pediatrician to see what they recommend. Many times, an infant\u2019s hernia will close all on its own over time, but if it hasn\u2019t gone away by the time your child is 5 years old, they may need a small procedure to have it fixed.Umbilical hernias are common with infants, and they usually don\u2019t cause your child any pain or discomfort.\n3. Let your doctor know if you have a hernia while you\u2019re pregnant. Because of the extra strain on your body, hernias are fairly common among pregnant women. If you suspect you have a hernia, talk to your doctor so they can check it out. Your doctor will most likely want to wait until after birth and recovery before treating the hernia if you need surgery, but you and your baby should be safe in the meantime.As much as you can, avoid heavy lifting and make sure to eat a high-fiber diet to prevent constipation.\n4. Visit your doctor as soon as possible if your hernia looks dark red or purple. This can be a sign that your hernia is strangulated. When this happens, your hernia is cutting off the blood flow to part of your intestine and requires medical treatment. Go to the doctor to make sure you\u2019re okay because you may need emergency treatment.Try your best to not worry or panic\u2014your doctor will be able to fix your hernia.\n5. Seek emergency care if you have pain, nausea, vomiting, or blocked bowels. Sometimes a hernia can block off part of your intestines. This means your bowel movements can get caught behind the hernia, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloating. You will likely not be able to pass gas or have a bowel movement. See your doctor or go to the emergency room if this happens because you likely need medical treatment.This is a treatable condition, though it can be really scary at the moment. As soon as you suspect a problem, get medical attention so you can get back to normal as soon as possible.\n6. Have a surgical procedure done to correct your hernia and prevent future ones. These procedures are generally pretty quick and you should get to go home that same day. The surgeon will usually make a small incision near the hernia and push it back into place. From there, they will sew and reinforce the tear so that the hernia will be less likely to protrude again.Make sure to follow all recovery instructions after your surgery. You\u2019ll need to take it easy and avoid heavy lifting for a while, and you\u2019ll probably also have pain medication to take.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to help end homelessness?","response":"Homelessness can feel like a daunting problem, especially as the population grows and living costs continue to rise. Helping to end homelessness will ensure no one has to go without a permanent, stable place to live. Give back to homeless organizations and participate in events that focus on ending homelessness. Advocating for changes to policies and laws around homelessness and treating homeless people with respect can also help to address this important issue.\n\n## Support homeless organizations and group\n\n1. Volunteer your time to a local homeless shelter. Start small by volunteering weekly or monthly at a homeless shelter in your area. Sign up to volunteer to serve food to the homeless or to create care packages for the homeless. You may challenge yourself to volunteer for 2-4 hours a week or twice a month. Or you may devote time during the holidays to work at a homeless shelter. Enlist friends or family to volunteer with you at a homeless shelter.\n2. Donate your skills to a non-profit organization that focuses on homelessness. Search for non-profit groups and organizations that work on initiatives for ending homelessness in your area. Contact them and offer to help them in any way you can. Put skills you already have to good use by donating them to the organization. For example, if you have coding skills, you may offer to update the organization\u2019s website. Or if you love talking to people, you may offer to work in a call center or go door to door to promote the non-profit organization.\n3. Give monetary donations to homeless groups and organizations. Donating money to homeless organizations can go a long way to helping with this issue. You may give a large sum once a year to a specific program for the homeless or to the organization as whole. Regular giving, where you give a small amount once weekly or once a month, can also help. Donate to a homeless organization as a gift for a friend or in memory of someone close to you. Make a holiday donation to the organization as a way to give back. Raise money for these organizations by setting up a fundraiser online for them or by asking others for donations.\n4. Go to fundraisers for homeless organizations. Show your support for ending homelessness by attending fundraisers and events that address the issue. Check your local community board for events to raise funds for a local homeless shelter or drop in center. Find out if there are fundraisers in your area that you can donate time or money to. Donate an item for a silent auction at an event for the homeless. Bid on items to help raise money for the issue. Invite friends and family to fundraisers to benefit the homeless so they can participate as well.\n5. Participate in food and clothing drives for the homeless. Donate clothing or food for the drive. Volunteer to collect food and clothing for the drive. Promote the food and clothing drive on social media to get others to donate. Warm coats, socks, scarves, and hats are all good options for a clothing drive. Non-perishable food like canned goods, crackers, and granola bars are ideal donations for a food drive. Most communities will run annual food and clothing drives, especially around Christmas time when the weather is cold and homeless people need more support. Check your community board or at your community center for information on upcoming food or clothing drives. Your school or your church may also run a food and clothing drive for the homeless.\n\n\n## Advocate for homeless policies and laws\n\n1. Write or call your government representative about ending homelessness. Many long term solutions for homelessness require changes to existing policies and laws. Contact your representative in government and ask them what they are doing to help end homelessness. Remind them that homelessness is an important issue that their constituents care about and want to address. Search online for contact information for your government representative. Calling them directly will be more effective than writing a letter. Messaging them publicly on social media can also be effective. For example, you may write to your mayor or you may contact your senator. You can also reach out to city council members to find out how they plan to address the issue. In your letter or call, advocate for more investment in affordable housing and social services to help prevent homelessness. Discuss the need for services that help homeless people find permanent homes and stay off the street. Note the need for counseling and rehabilitation centers for homeless people with addiction issues so they can get better and find employment.\n2. Support political candidates that care about ending homelessness. Put your right to vote to work by only supporting candidates who discuss ending homelessness in their platforms and during their campaigns. Promote them on social media and volunteer for their campaign. Cast your vote for them on election day. Tell friends and family about political candidates who discuss ending homelessness so they can stay informed and vote.\n3. Organize a march or protest that focuses on support for the homeless. Let others know about this important issue by organizing a march or a peaceful protest that focuses on ending homelessness. Invite friends, family members, and colleagues to the march. Promote the march or protest on social media so others can participate. Make signs that note the importance of ending homelessness and bring them to the march. Use a megaphone at the protest to give speeches about the issue. Have the march or protest in a public space, such as in front of a government building or in a public square.\n4. Work towards a career as a politician, lobbyist, or non-profit worker. Do well in your social studies and history classes in high school. Join a school debate team or public speaking club to get better at these skills. Take classes in political science, history, and conflict resolution in university. Get involved in local politics and non-profit organizations. Apply to positions as a lobbyist or a non-profit worker so you can work to actively end homelessness on a day to day basis. Run for local office with a platform that focuses on ending homelessness in your community.\n\n\n## Treat homeless people with respect\n\n1. Acknowledge the homeless person with a smile or nod. Rather than rushing by them without looking at them, make eye contact and smile or nod at them. Let them know that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. This is a small way for you to show empathy for them. Avoid yelling, shouting, or mocking the homeless person, as this will only make them feel more alienated and alone. Treat them like a friend or family member, showing care and respect for them.\n2. Try starting a conversation with the homeless person. Ask them how they are doing. Find out where they are from. Keep the conversation open and friendly. Maintain eye contact when you talk to them so they know you care. For example, you may say, \u201cHow are you today?\u201d or \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d\n\t* If the homeless person does not seem interested in answering your questions, don\u2019t pressure them into answering. Let them decide if they want to engage with you on a deeper level.\n3. Offer to buy the homeless person a meal. If you have the time and funds, offer to grab the person a cup of coffee or a sandwich from somewhere nearby. Getting the person a warm meal may make their day and help them feel less down about their situation. The meal does not have to be elaborate or expensive. A cup of coffee or a small snack would likely be appreciated by the person.\n4. Give the homeless person a care package. Prepare a care package that contains important items like socks, warm gloves, toothpaste, lip balm, and non-perishable food like crackers or nuts. Give out the care packages to homeless people in your area so they have supplies that they need. Make it a habit to hand out care packages to homeless people once a month or regularly during the winter months.\n5. Decide to give the person money if you feel comfortable. Giving money to a homeless person is a personal preference and completely up to you. Handing change or a few bucks to a homeless person can be a demonstration of empathy and help them in a very direct way. You may decide to give the person a meal, rather than money. Or you may sometimes give the person money and offer them food other times.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to teach a child to use scissors?","response":"Most children around age 2 or 3 are ready to begin using scissors. It's important for children to know how to be safe with scissors. Once they're ready, using scissors can be an excellent way for the child to build fine motor skills and patience.\n\n## Prepare to teach\n\n1. Try fine motor skill activities to prepare the child for using scissors. Children need to build fine motor skills before they're ready to use scissors. Here are some activities that can help build the child's skills, and help you know if the child is ready:\n\t* Precision: Squeezing watercolor paint from an eyedropper onto paper, playing with finger puppets\n\t* \n\t* Bilateral coordination: Tearing up paper from the recycling bin\n\t* \n\t* Finger and hand strength: Spinning a top, punching holes with a hole punch, playing with squirt guns, using clothes pins\n2. Evaluate the child's ability to follow directions. The child should be able to follow instructions like \"stop\" or \"put it down, please.\" If a child isn't able to follow safety rules, then they shouldn't be given anything dangerous.\n3. Choose the right pair of scissors. Safety scissors are ideal for young children. Choose right-handed or left-handed scissors based on your child's dominant hand.\n4. Know that most kids are ready to use scissors around the age of 2 or 3. Many young children are able to use scissors.Talk to an occupational therapist if you think your child is struggling or has a disability that might delay their learning to use scissors. There are adaptive scissors for kids with disabilities, and special techniques to help kids who struggle with scissors. A delay isn't the end of the world. It just means things will happen a little differently.\n\n\n## Teach how to use scissor\n\n1. Let the child see you use a scissors. Show them how you do it, and let them watch. If they're curious, then you'll know they're most likely ready to learn.\n2. Start with the grip. Show the child in your hand how to hold the scissors, and then have them try to copy it. If they aren't able to alone, help move their fingers and thumb into the right position. Teach them that the thumb always goes in the hole. Draw an eyeball on the small thumb hole and explain that the eyeball will always be on top. Teach them that two fingers in the larger hole. Help them put their index finger and their middle finger in the hole.\n3. Have the child practice opening and closing the scissors. This practice will help the child build up the strength to control the scissors.\n4. Try having the child do their best to cut in a line or other shapes. Try drawing lines or shapes for the child to cut. After they do it, praise them. (Keep in mind that they may not be very precise yet; they're still young.)\n5. Find ways to make it fun. Let the child be creative. Try letting them cut colored paper, yarn, and other materials. Using scissors can be another way the child works on expressing themselves (all while building essential motor skills).\n6. Practice with the child how to turn the paper with one hand and cut with the other. This will prevent the child from turning the scissors up side down. Show the how to move the paper along with shuffling motions so that they maintain control of both the paper and the scissors.\n\n\n## Teach scissor safety\n\n1. Tell the child that scissors can hurt people if misused. It helps if kids don't just know what the rules are, but if they know why the rules are important. Explain that using scissors the wrong way can result in somebody getting hurt, and that's why the rules matter. Tell them that as long as they are following the rules, they don't have to worry.\n2. Explain that scissors are only for cutting paper. Fingers, hair, clothing, crayons, and other things are off-limits. If you decide to have the child practice with cutting Play Doh first, you can say that scissors are only for paper and Play Doh.If the child asks about why scissors are used for haircuts, explain \"Only adults can use scissors to cut hair, because they have more practice to make sure they don't mess up. Some adults go to a hair cutting school to learn how to do it right, and once they go there, they're allowed to cut hair.\"\n3. Explain that you need to walk carefully with scissors, if at all. Scissors can hurt people, so it's important to be careful. Some adults forbid walking with scissors at all, while others allow children to do it if the kids are careful. The best way to walk with scissors is to hold the closed blades in the fist. Walking this way reduces the risk of the child playing with the blades while walking, or falling and hurting themselves on the blades. Explain that running with scissors is extremely dangerous. If the child is going too fast, say \"Walking feet\" to remind them to slow down. Take away the scissors if they continue behaving dangerously.\n4. Take away the scissors if the child doesn't follow the rules. Give a reminder, and see if the child listens. If not, then you may decide to take away scissor privileges until the child is ready for another chance. Safety comes first.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to do the rumba?","response":"The rumba is a Latin dance that is popular all over the world. It's so simple to learn and can be danced to lots of music. Traditionally rumba uses latin music, but a lot of pop songs have the perfect tempo and rhythm, too! Learn to lead the steps, or follow your partner if you aren't as coordinated. Once you get the basic steps down, rumba gives you the freedom to groove with the music!\n\n## Position your body\n\n1. Clasp hands with your partner with elbows at a 90 degree angle. As the leader, raise your left hand. As the follower, raise your right hand. Keep your elbow close to your partner\u2019s elbow and almost touching it. Make sure your arm stays up and at a strict angle.\n2. Place your other hand behind your partner\u2019s shoulder. If you are the leader, put your right hand behind follower\u2019s left shoulder. If you are the follower, put your left hand behind the leader\u2019s right shoulder. Keep your arm straight and close against your partner\u2019s arm.\n3. Start with your feet close together side-by-side. When you are in position with your partner, make sure that both of you keep your feet close together side-by-side. You\u2019ll move your feet apart and back together as you perform the steps, so it\u2019s important that they are tight together when you start.\n4. Center your body and weight over the balls of your feet. Rumba requires quick, decisive movements, so always stay on the balls of your feet. Make sure you don\u2019t lean forward, backward, or sideways. As you perform the steps, keep yourself balanced.\n5. Maintain eye contact. You must stay in sync with your partner, and keeping your eyes locked is the best way to do it. Don't watch your feet or look around the room, or you are likely to lose the rhythm of your partner. Keeping eye contact helps you focus on the steps rather than on your surroundings.If your partner is not the same height as you, work together to split the height difference. Each of you should tilt your head either up or down so your eyes meet in the middle.\n\n\n## Lead the rumba\n\n1. Take a slow step straight forward with your left foot. Slide your foot gently forward, as opposed to lifting your foot off the ground and stomping down. Count two beats with the music when you take the first step. Keep the step light and stay on the ball of your foot. When you\u2019re a beginner, it\u2019s helpful to count the beats for each step of the rumba. Count the steps as either 1-2 (first step\/fourth step), 3 (second step\/fifth step) , 4 (third step\/sixth step) or as slow-quick-quick. Since your partner will mirror this step by stepping back, it\u2019s important to monitor their speed so you don\u2019t step on their foot.\n2. Step your right foot at a 45 degree angle away from its starting point. This step starts your body moving to the side, as your first step started moving you forward. Your feet should end up being shoulder width apart and directly in line from left to right. This step lasts one beat and your next step follows immediately, so be ready for another quick step. Keep your toes pointing forward when you set your foot down.\n3. Slide your left foot so it\u2019s next your right foot. Close the gap between your feet with this third step. This is a quick step that lasts one beat. When you finish the step, your feet should almost be touching. Make sure your weight is centered over both feet once again. You don\u2019t actually want to slide your foot along the ground, but only lift it enough to move it. You\u2019ll slow your step down if you lift it too high off of the ground. Quickly make any minor adjustments to your or your partner\u2019s position as you move into the second phase of the steps.\n4. Step backward slowly with your right foot. Move your right foot backward so it\u2019s roughly in line with where you started. Plant the ball of your foot and then lower your heel to the ground. Make sure this step lasts for two beats. The next step follows quickly, so make sure you are balanced on your right foot.\n5. Slide your left foot diagonally back to where it started. Take this step quickly so that it lasts one beat. Make sure your feet are shoulder width apart in a straight line. In the basic box step, your left foot should be in the same place it started. Shift the weight slightly onto your left foot in preparation for the next step.\n6. Close the gap between your feet by stepping with your right foot. Make this step quickly so that it only lasts for one beat. You are back where you started with your feet close together. Check that your weight is centered and distributed evenly between both feet. If you performed the steps correctly, the entire process takes eight beats. This should be two measures of music.\n\n\n## Follow the leader\n\n1. Step back slowly with your right foot. As the follower, mirror your partner\u2019s steps as closely as possible. At the same time that they move their left foot forward, your right foot must go backward. Match the distance that they step so your feet are as close as they were to start. This step lasts two beats. Be sure to step at the same speed as your partner.\n2. Step quickly at a backward diagonal with your left foot. As your partner steps diagonally with their right foot, mirror the step backwards. This step lasts for one beat, so you must step quickly. If you step too slowly, your partner may kick your foot when they step forward. End this step with your feet shoulder width apart, and with neither foot farther forward or backward. Shift your weight onto your left foot so you are ready for the next step.\n3. Slide your right foot toward your left foot quickly. Barely lift your right foot off of the ground, and plant it next to your left foot. Make this step at the same time as your partner so you move sideways together. You should be standing at a 45 degree angle from your starting spot. Make sure your weight is centered over your feet.\n4. Move your left foot forward slowly. As your partner moves back in the second phase, you move forward. Mirror their right foot moving backward with your left foot moving forward. Imagine your foot is pulled by their foot. Go slowly so this step takes two beats to accomplish. Be sure to shift your weight onto that left foot so you are ready to take the next step.\n5. Take a quick step with your right foot at 45 degrees forward. Move your feet back to parallel with this step. Make sure they are still shoulder width apart and directly across from your partner\u2019s feet. Be sure to step quickly so it takes one beat. Shift your weight slightly onto your right foot as you prepare to take the final step.\n6. Slide your left foot toward your right foot into its original place. Take this final step quickly and in time with your partner. Your feet end up close together and on the same place on the floor that they started.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The rumba is a Latin dance.","max_prob":14.0395526886,"ccp":-0.3708099258},{"claim":"The rumba is popular all over the world.","max_prob":14.9497308731,"ccp":-0.3722491781},{"claim":"Traditionally, rumba uses Latin music.","max_prob":17.0000801086,"ccp":-0.0898657042},{"claim":"A lot of pop songs have the perfect tempo and rhythm for rumba.","max_prob":22.9268684387,"ccp":-0.8118085362},{"claim":"You have a partner.","max_prob":0.205135107,"ccp":-0.9821956925},{"claim":"You clasp hands with your partner.","max_prob":12.1854476929,"ccp":-0.0715979923},{"claim":"Your elbows are at a 90 degree angle when clasping hands.","max_prob":22.6612758636,"ccp":-0.0049590861},{"claim":"Your feet are close together.","max_prob":4.4380145073,"ccp":-0.6388330177},{"claim":"Your feet are side-by-side.","max_prob":9.5140419006,"ccp":-0.6287266962},{"claim":"You will move your feet apart as you perform the steps.","max_prob":16.0091228485,"ccp":-0.6470685937},{"claim":"You will move your feet back together as you perform the steps.","max_prob":16.6265945435,"ccp":-0.1410897937},{"claim":"It is important that your feet are tight together when you start.","max_prob":16.969285965,"ccp":-0.5999567862},{"claim":"Rumba requires quick movements.","max_prob":7.7123475075,"ccp":-0.897129328},{"claim":"Rumba requires decisive movements.","max_prob":11.4092617035,"ccp":-0.3406355957},{"claim":"You should always stay on the balls of your feet when doing Rumba.","max_prob":10.698554039,"ccp":-0.7761840775},{"claim":"You must stay in sync with your partner.","max_prob":10.538526535,"ccp":-0.4396465591},{"claim":"Keeping your eyes locked is the best way to stay in sync with your partner.","max_prob":17.72631073,"ccp":-0.4050432104},{"claim":"Your partner will mirror this step by stepping back.","max_prob":26.882396698,"ccp":-0.0941161304},{"claim":"It is important to monitor your partner's speed.","max_prob":18.4814968109,"ccp":-0.3995227787},{"claim":"Monitoring your partner's speed helps to avoid stepping on their foot.","max_prob":22.2433185577,"ccp":-0.1671137873},{"claim":"This step lasts one beat.","max_prob":8.4525489807,"ccp":-0.418003524},{"claim":"Your next step follows immediately.","max_prob":16.8086166382,"ccp":-0.0006936375},{"claim":"Be ready for another quick step.","max_prob":17.4644107819,"ccp":-0.2206008001},{"claim":"There is a step.","max_prob":3.7502954006,"ccp":-0.1950400552},{"claim":"The step is quick.","max_prob":3.7502954006,"ccp":-0.1950400552},{"claim":"The step lasts one beat.","max_prob":1.7520319223,"ccp":-0.6818401419},{"claim":"The basic box step is a dance step.","max_prob":11.3290805817,"ccp":-0.0182076986},{"claim":"Your left foot should be in the same place it started during the basic box step.","max_prob":24.1654109955,"ccp":-0.0207775637},{"claim":"There is a step.","max_prob":0.4721169472,"ccp":-1.0},{"claim":"The step has a duration.","max_prob":1.6549426317,"ccp":-0.5614910532},{"claim":"The duration of the step is two beats.","max_prob":1.6549426317,"ccp":-0.5614910532},{"claim":"This step lasts for one beat.","max_prob":3.1349933147,"ccp":-0.7992337809},{"claim":"You must step quickly.","max_prob":7.0024037361,"ccp":-0.3780335047},{"claim":"Your feet should be shoulder width apart.","max_prob":1.8177162409,"ccp":-0.7097901251},{"claim":"Neither foot should be farther forward.","max_prob":14.7509384155,"ccp":-0.0000536316},{"claim":"Neither foot should be farther backward.","max_prob":14.4819116592,"ccp":-0.000071825},{"claim":"Your partner moves back in the second phase.","max_prob":17.6296348572,"ccp":-0.1249954187},{"claim":"You move forward.","max_prob":2.5229387283,"ccp":-0.7764977551}]}
{"instruction":"How to get a known traveler number?","response":"If you love traveling but can't stand the long customs lines, then it might be worth it for you to get a Known Traveler Number (KTN). A KTN is a number that's issued by either the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Department of Defense (DoD). This number indicates that the person who has it has undergone a pre-flight background check before checking in for their flight and is eligible for an expedited customs experience. To get a KTN, apply for TSA Precheck, Global Entry, NEXUS, or SENTRI.\n\n## Get a ktn through tsa precheck\n\n1. Go for TSA Precheck if you only travel within the United States. If you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you just travel within the United States, this may be the program for you. Get your KTN through TSA Precheck so that you don't have to bother with getting a passport.\n2. Pre-enroll for TSA Precheck online. In order to start the application process, visit https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov. Here, you'll disclose basic biographical information, such as your name, birthdate, and address.\n3. Make an appointment at an application center. After you finish filling out the brief form, you'll be prompted to make an appointment for your interview. For TSA Precheck, you can choose from over 300 locations within the United States. Find a location near you by going to https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov\/locator.\n4. Go to your in-person interview. Before you head to your scheduled interview, make sure that you have a valid photo ID, a valid proof of citizenship, and immigration documentation if applicable. The interview should only take about 15 minutes, and you'll be asked questions about yourself and your travel habits, and you'll also be fingerprinted during this time. Your driver's license can serve as a valid photo ID. Your passport or birth certificate can serve as a valid proof of citizenship.\n5. Pay the $85 application fee. At the interview, you'll need to pay your nonrefundable application fee, which will cover the cost of having a background check done. You can pay with a credit card, money order, company check, or cashier's check.\n6. Check your application status online. After your interview, check the status of your application by going to https:\/\/universalenroll.dhs.gov\/workflows?workflow=service-status&servicecode=11115V. You'll likely receive a notification letter within 1-2 days of your interview, but it can sometimes take up to 45 days. If you're approved, your notification letter will include your 9-digit KTN.\n7. Add your KTN to each reservation. Every time you book a flight, type in your KTN number wherever it's asked for. This way, you'll be recognized as a known traveler, which means you won't have to take off your shoes, belt, or jacket, or take out your laptop or liquids. If you book through a travel agent, be sure to give the travel agent you KTN. Contact your airline via phone or online to add your KTN to your reservation after you've already booked it.\n\n\n## Apply for global entry\n\n1. Choose Global Entry if you travel internationally. While TSA Precheck allows you to to enjoy a faster customs experience while traveling within the United States, Global Entry allows you to breeze through customs while traveling within the United States and also internationally. Get your KTN through Global Entry if you're a lawful U.S. citizen or permanent resident and you travel outside the country. You can also apply for Global Entry if you are a citizen of India, citizen of Colombia, citizen of the United Kingdom, citizen of Germany, citizen of Panama, citizen of Singapore, citizen of South Korea, citizen of Switzerland, or a Mexican National.\n2. Create a GOES account and apply for Global Entry. Navigate to https:\/\/ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click \u201cGet Started\u201d to create an account. Then, log into your account. You'll have several different programs to choose from, so make sure you click on \u201cGlobal Entry\u201d and then fill out the application. This should take about half an hour and will require information such as your passport information, your residence history, and your employment history.\n3. Pay the $100 application fee online. At the end of the Global Entry application, you will be prompted to fill in your credit card or bank account information in order to pay for the application fee. The fee is $100 and is valid for 5 years. Some credit cards, specifically the ones designed for frequent fliers and corporate travelers, may reimburse you for this fee.\n4. Wait to receive an email. Once you've applied and paid the fee, check your inbox for an email. You can expect this email to come within a week or so of submitting the application. The email will prompt you to log in to your GOES account, which will notify you that you're approved, pending your interview, if everything on your application checked out. If you don't receive an email, try calling the Global Entry customer service phone line at 866-530-4172.\n5. Schedule an interview at an enrollment center. While logged into your GOES account, you'll be prompted to pick an interview day, time, and location. Here, you can look up the enrollment centers that are closest to where you are. If you live in or near a major city, look into a few different locations, as some may be able to take you the next day but others may have a month-long wait.\n6. Go to your scheduled interview. The interview questions are typically simple and straightforward. You can expect to be asked about basic topics such as your traveling tendencies and your employment status. If you're approved, your fingerprints will be taken and you'll get your KTN at the end of the interview.\n7. Scan your passport at an airport kiosk to use your KTN. Bring your passport to the airport every time you fly, and scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. Then, the kiosk will take your photo, scan your fingerprints, and print out your receipt, which you'll hand to the customs agent. This will get you access to an expedited customs experience.\n\n\n## Become a member of nexus\n\n1. Apply for NEXUS if you travel to Canada often. NEXUS is similar to Global Entry, but it only allows you to move through customs quicker when you're traveling domestically within the U.S. or you're crossing the border of the United States and Canada. Choose this program if you're a lawful Canadian citizen\/permanent resident or a lawful U.S. citizen\/permanent resident who needs to frequently cross the border. You can go to Canada without a passport if you're a U.S. citizen and you become a member of NEXUS.\n2. Create a GOES account. Get online and navigate to ttp.cbp.dhs.gov. Click on \u201cRegister in English\u201d and fill out the prompted information to create a GOES account. When you're done, you'll receive an identification number and be a registered GOES user.\n3. Complete the NEXUS application online. Through your GOES account, download the NEXUS application online. Complete it, and provide copies of all of the government documents that the application requires, including your proof of citizenship or permanent residence, a valid passport, and proof of your current residence. Submit the application when you're finished with it.\n4. Pay the $50 fee online. The processing fee for applying to become a member of NEXUS is $50, which is the most affordable of all of the program fees. Pay this online with a credit card through your GOES account.\n5. Schedule an interview through your GOES account. Once your application has been processed, you'll get a notification through your GOES account that you need to schedule an interview at an enrollment center. There are only a few locations where you can do this, and all of them can be found at http:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/prog\/nexus\/location-eng.html.\n6. Gather required documents and forms of ID for your NEXUS interview. You'll need to bring a valid driver's license, proof of residency, your NEXUS conditional approval letter, and any documents that you used on your application to prove you're a U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident, Canadian citizen, or Canadian permanent resident. Bring your vehicle's title and registration if you plan to drive across the border. Bring your proof of custody if you plan to take a child under the age of 18 across the border.\n7. Go to your NEXUS interview. Attend your scheduled interview at the location you chose. Your interview should take about 30 minutes, and you'll be asked questions by both a U.S. customs officer and a Canadian customs officer during this time. If the interview goes well and you're approved for membership, you'll also be fingerprinted. During the interview, you might be asked questions like, \u201cWhy do you want a NEXUS card?\u201d or \u201cDo you still live at this address?\u201d\n8. Scan your passport at Global Entry kiosks when you travel. As a NEXUS member, you can use your KTN the same way that Global Entry members use it. When you travel, find a Global Entry kiosk, scan your passport, and proceed as the kiosk guides you to. Just like with Global Entry members, you can give the receipt that \u2018s printed at this kiosk to the customs agent in order to have an expedited customs experience.\n9. Add your PASSID to your reservations and frequent flier profiles. When you become a NEXUS member, you'll be issued a PASSID, which is exactly the same as a KTN. If you'd rather check in before heading to the airport, be sure to include your PASSID in the appropriate field when you fill out your flight registration information.\n\n\n## Acquire your ktn through sentri\n\n1. Choose SENTRI if you travel to Mexico often. The benefits of being a SENTRI member are specific to crossing the U.S. and Mexican border. Go with this program to get your KTN if you're a lawful U.S. citizen who travels to Mexico on a regular basis.\n2. Create a GOES account online. SENTRI is another program that requires you to have a GOES account. Register by clicking \u201cGet Started,\u201d and filling out all of the prompted information on https:\/\/ttp.cbp.dhs.gov.\n3. Complete an online application. After you've gotten a GOES account, you can log in and find the application for SENTRI. Fill it out entirely and include copies of any documents that the application requires of you. You'll likely need to supply copies of your passport and your proof of citizenship or proof of permanent residence.\n4. Pay the SENTRI fee of $122.25. This fee covers the application fee, the fingerprint fee, as well as the system cost fee. After you finish filling out the application, you'll have an opportunity to pay this nonrefundable fee. Make the payment with a credit card, certified check, money order, or through electronic bank transfer.\n5. Schedule to your SENTRI interview at an enrollment center. Once your application is conditionally approved, you'll be instructed through your GOES account to make an appointment for your interview. There are many different locations that you can choose from, all of which are considered \u201cenrollment centers.\u201d\n6. Go to your scheduled interview with the required documents. Bring the required documents with you and answer the interviewer's questions truthfully. You'll then be approved and fingerprinted if the interview goes well.\n7. Scan your passport at a Global Entry kiosk. To reap the benefits of your SENTRI membership, head to the Global Entry kiosk and scan your passport before you go to customs. The kiosk will prompt you to answer a couple of questions and it will take your photo and scan your fingerprints. It will then print out a receipt that you can give to the customs agent so that you can move quickly through.\n8. Include your PASSID in your flight reservations. If you'd rather not worry about dealing with the kiosk before your flight, you can simply include your PASSID (KTN) on your reservation when you book your flight. That way, your precheck privileges will be noted on your boarding pass and you can skip the kiosk altogether.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"A

{"instruction":"How to make felt?","response":"Felting is fun no matter what your age. Once you learn the process of felting, you can let your imagination be your guide and move on to other, more complex shapes. Felt sheets are the most basic, but felt balls can be just as fun to make.When you are done, you can turn your handmade felt into pretty patches or beaded garlands!\n\n## Make a felt sheet\n\n1. Use your fingers to pull apart some wool into tufts. Do not cut the wool into tufts. This will create sharp edges and make it difficult to felt. Also, be sure to get pure wool and not acrylic; acrylic fibers will not felt. Many crafters will recommend Merino wool for its fine fibers. The wool does not have to be naturally colored! Consider getting some dyed wool!\n2. Lay the tufts out on a baking sheet, overlapping each row like scales on a fish. Make sure that the fibers are all going in the same direction. You do not have to cover the entire baking sheet; an 8 by 8 inch (20.32 by 20.32 centimeters) square will be plenty.\n3. Lay out more tufts in a second layer with the fibers going perpendicular to the last one. For example, if all the tufts were going up-and-down in the first layer, make all the tufts go side-to-side in this layer. You can also experiment with using a different color of wool for this layer. Be sure to use a color that complements the first one, however, or you might get a muddy result.\n4. Repeat the first two layers, if desired, for a thicker felt sheet. Remember to alternate the direction in which the fibers are going with each layer. Two layers is perfectly fine for a thin piece of felt, but if you'd like something thicker, aim for three or four layers total. Consider adding some pieces of loose-weave fabric or bits of Merino yarn on top for color and texture.\n5. Cover the layers with a piece of tulle or sheer polyester fabric. This will help keep the fibers in place during the felting process. The fabric needs to be big enough to cover the entire wool sheet.\n6. Make your felting solution and pour it into a spray bottle. Keep the rest of the felting solution handy to refill the bottle as needed. You will need 1 tablespoon of dish soap and 1 quart (950 milliliters) of hot water. Don't shake the bottle, or you will create too many suds. The hotter the water is, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that it is uncomfortable to work with, however.\n7. Spray the wool down, then gently massage it with a piece of soapy bubble wrap. Don't be tempted to pour the water onto the wool. This will cause the fibers to move around too much. Instead, spray it down with your hot, soapy water until it is completely saturated (but not dripping). Ball up some bubble wrap, rub it over a piece of bar soap, then gently massage the felt using small, circular motions. If you accidentally soaked the wool, use a small sponge to mop up the excess water.\n8. Continue pressing on the wool until the fibers come together. Pour the water off as it cools, and spray more hot, soapy water onto it. Be sure to tuck in any loose or stray fibers as you work. This will make the edges of your sheet a little more even.\n9. When the wool is ready, transfer it to a sheet of bubble wrap and peel off the tulle or polyester fabric. You can tell if the wool is ready by doing a simple pinch test. Pinch a piece of the wool between your thumb and forefinger. If it stays in place and doesn't come off, you can move on the to the next step. If it lifts away, then continue pressing the wool. The bubble wrap needs to be textured side up.\n10. Roll up the bubble wrap tightly. Start by folding an inch (2.54 centimeters) of so of bubble wrap over the bottom edge of the felted wool to create a seam. Next, roll the wool up as tightly as you can along with the bubble wrap, starting from the bottom. Press down as you roll the wool to drain off any excess water.\n11. Roll the bubble wrap tube across a flat surface for about five minutes. Roll it gently at first, then with increasing pressure later on. Don't over-felt or over-work your wool.\n12. Rinse the sheet with cold water, then squeeze it to drain off the excess water. The cold water rinse will help set the fibers. Gently press down onto the felt sheet to squeeze out the excess water. Do not wring or twist it. Consider adding a splash of white vinegar to the water. This will remove excess soap and restore the natural pH of the wool; it will brighten the wool's colors and help it last longer.\n13. Lay the wool out some place flat to dry. The wool will have shrunk and thickened during the felting process. It may also shrink a little bit more while it dries. This is completely natural.\n14. Use your felted wool. You can cut it into squares and sew it onto a bag to make patches. You can also cut it into circles to make coasters. The possibilities are endless!\n\n\n## Make felt ball\n\n1. Pull apart some raw wool into tufts. Do not cut the tufts. If you cut them, you will get sharp edges that will be harder to felt. You can use natural, uncolored wool, or wool that has been dyed bright colors. The size of the tufts doesn't really matter, but a 4 to 5-inch long (10 to 12 centimeters) tuft will give you a bead about the size of a cherry.\n2. Fill a small tub with hot water and add some liquid dish soap into it. You will need 2 tablespoons of dish soap for every 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Gently swish the water to mix, but not so much to create suds. The hotter the water, the faster the wool will felt. The water shouldn't be so hot that you can't handle it, however.\n3. Gather a few tufts into a ball, then roll them between your palms. Don't worry about forming a firm ball just yet. You can use all one color of wool, or several different colors for a more interesting felt ball.\n4. Soak the ball in the hot, soapy water. Hold the ball between your fingers, then dip it into the hot, soapy water. Don't worry if the ball starts to lose its shape and sag. You will reshape it in the next step.\n5. Roll the ball between your palms until it becomes firm. The ball will be loose at first, but then it will start to become more firm. This will take about 10 minutes. Be careful not to squeeze it too much. If you are making multiple beads, the water may cool down while you work. When that happens, replace the tub with more hot, soapy water.\n6. When the wool is firm, rinse it off with cold water. This will get rid of the soap and help set the fibers. If you'd like, you can then soak it in some water with a splash of white vinegar in it. This will help remove the rest of the soap and brighten the wool's color.\n7. Gently press the ball in a towel to remove excess water. Be careful not to squeeze too hard, of you may distort the ball.\n8. Allow the felt ball to air dry. This will take about 24 hours. Remember, just because the ball is dry on the outside does not necessarily mean that it is dry on the inside.\n9. Consider threading the balls onto some twine to make a garland. Poke a hole through each ball using a darning needle, and pull some heavy thread through it. You may need to use needle nose pliers to help pull the needle through, especially of the felt balls are firm. Hang the garland wherever you like when you are done.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You can learn the process of

{"instruction":"How to deal with a married boyfriend?","response":"Entering into a relationship with a married man might seem appealing to some women; however, it can also become a very difficult and painful experience.  There are many reasons why a woman might be attracted to a married man and learning these reasons as well as the difficulties of such a relationship can help you decide what to do.\n\n## Learn the risk\n\n1. Be aware that he likely won't leave his wife. Although your boyfriend may claim he is willing to or about to leave his wife, most married men are not actually ready or planning to do so. During your time with your boyfriend, you should understand that the chances of him leaving his wife to be with you exclusively are small. If he is finalizing his divorce, then he may actually be serious about leaving his wife. Most men will not leave their wife to be with their girlfriend.\n2. Realize that he will always be connected to his family. If your boyfriend has children with his wife, you should understand that he will always have a connection to his children and possibly with his wife. Even if your boyfriend leaves his wife, his children will still be part of his life and he may be required to share visitation rights with her. Be prepared for this if you continue to pursue your relationship with him.\n3. Prepare yourself for a difficult relationship. Dating a married man is almost always a difficult relationship and is one that is likely to emotionally hurt those involved. You should be fully aware of this if you plan to continue your relationship with your married boyfriend.\n\n\n## Understand why women want to date a marry man\n\n1. Examine your relationship for any thrill seeking behavior. The hidden nature of your relationship may be what keeps one or both of you interested. Sneaking around, keeping secrets and hiding the relationship can all be exhilarating and boost the attachment between the two of you. Understand that if you are interested in your boyfriend because of the thrill, an exclusive relationship with him will likely lose its appeal.\n2. Ask yourself if you have based the relationship in competition. Some women are highly competitive and this competitive nature can express itself in relationships as well. Women who desire a married man may do so because they feel that they are a superior woman to the man's wife. This can cause them to pursue the husband in order to prove to themselves and others that they are the \u201cwinner\u201d.\n3. Discover any issues with trust that you may have. Some women may have difficulty trusting a man. The appeal of seeing a married man is found in the fact that they can't be cheated on because they are the one doing the cheating. Women who have a married boyfriend are also not likely to be restricted in who they themselves are allowed to see romantically. A lack of trust can be the reason behind your relationship.\n\n\n## Date during a divorce\n\n1. Be aware of your boyfriend's wife. Although you may be dating your boyfriend during his divorce, you will still have to contend with how his wife might view you. You will have to be careful with any interaction you might have with your boyfriend's wife as they may feel resentful towards you and try to cause you trouble. Your boyfriends wife may try to turn his children against you. The wife of your boyfriend might try to attack your image amongst family and friends. Your relationship may cause the divorce proceedings to take longer or become more expensive.\n2. Keep your relationship discreet. Dating your boyfriend during a divorce can be a troublesome and difficult time for both of you. Keeping your relationship discreet and private can help keep things as calm and stable as can be during the divorce proceedings. Wait until after the divorce before making your relationship a public one. Don't get involved with your boyfriend's children until after the divorce is finalized.\n3. Make sure your boyfriend is physically separated from his wife. If you start dating your boyfriend while he still lives with his wife, this might be legally determined to be the reason for the failure of his marriage. If your relationship is determined to be the reason his marriage failed it can cause your boyfriend to lose more of his assets during the divorce. Wait until your boyfriend is living away from his wife before dating.\n\n\n## Discover if your boyfriend be marry\n\n1. Take note of when your boyfriend is available. If your boyfriend is usually unavailable on weekends of evenings, but talks to you first thing in the morning, he might be married. Your boyfriend might be with his wife during these times and this can be the reason he isn't returning your calls or texts. Take note of when your boyfriend is available to talk. If he talks with you only during times when he is at work or away from home, he might be married. Unless he has to work on the weekends, he should be able to meet or talk with you.\n2. Think about how much you know about his personal life. Married men don't often share many details of their personal life. This might be an effort to cover up their marriage by exuding any information that could reveal it. Think of how much you know about your boyfriend and his personal life to see if he might be withholding any important information. He will likely not mention where he lives. Your boyfriend might not talk about his friends in case you might know them and ask them for more details about his life. He might not talk about his past relationships in order to avoid revealing anything about his current marriage.\n3. Ask yourself if your boyfriend hides his family from you. If your boyfriend is currently married there is a good chance that he will avoid taking you to meet his family. A married boyfriend will likely try to keep your relationship a secret. If you meet his family your relationship will be revealed. If you have been dating your boyfriend for a long period of time and he avoids a meeting between you and his family, he might be married.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to choose bridal lingerie?","response":"Choosing bridal lingerie is one of the many exciting things you get to do as bride-to-be, and it\u2019s something so personal that only you can do it. For lingerie that you\u2019re planning to wear under your dress on your big day, you\u2019ll need to choose a style that works well under your specific dress. If you\u2019re planning to get other lingerie to change into after the wedding, you have unlimited options with which you can surprise your fianc\u00e9!\n\n## Find lingerie for your dress\n\n1. Go with a slip and shapewear if you have a sheath dress. Light flowing fabrics make beautiful wedding gowns but may require a little extra support underneath to avoid showing unwanted bulges or panty lines. Find shapewear that hides any problem areas, and a slip made from similar fabric as your gown in case your gown slips. To reduce the layers you need to wear, try a shaping slip in the same color as your dress.\n2. Choose high-waisted shaping lingerie for a mermaid dress. Mermaid dresses show off all your natural curves by hugging your body, so consider lingerie that draws in your waist and doesn\u2019t show panty lines. A high-waisted thong is a good option, on its own or coupled with a bustier.\n3. Find a bustier or corset for your ballgown. Many ballgown style dresses already have a structured corset or bustier in them, but if yours doesn\u2019t, find one that matches the color of your dress. Choose a bustier bra that\u2019s seamless and strapless to support and lift your bust while slimming your torso. Panties for your ballgown can be any style you choose, since a ballgown is loose in the skirt area and you won\u2019t be able to see panty lines.\n4. Choose any lingerie for A-line dresses. A-line, or princess-style dresses, are fitted at the top and flow out below the bustline. If this is the type of dress you have, you can choose any lingerie based on your comfort or preference instead of shaping or support. Keep in mind the shape of the top of your dress when choosing a bra; if the dress has a deep neckline or is strapless, you\u2019ll want to find a strapless bra or skip a bra altogether.\n5. Find a backless bra with adhesive sides for a backless dress. If you have a halter or other type of backless dress, you may want support or coverage from your lingerie. Choose an adhesive bra that matches the color of your dress to get the support you need. Adhesive bras also work great for strapless dresses if you can\u2019t find a strapless bra that you like.\n6. Match the lingerie color to your dress. Try bringing a swatch of the fabric that your gown is made from with you when you shop for lingerie. Some bridal gown retailers offer a swatch so you can match accessories with your gown. If you don\u2019t have a sample of the fabric, try ordering more than one shade of lingerie and keep the one that best matches your gown. Matching your lingerie with your dress instead of your skin tone is helpful in case your gown slips a bit. Your lingerie won\u2019t be as obvious if the shade matches your dress.\n\n\n## Choose wed night lingerie\n\n1. Wear whatever you\u2019ll feel sexy in. There are certain myths surrounding wedding night lingerie that it has to look a certain way, but only you and your fianc\u00e9 know what you like. This means if you don\u2019t want to wear white, don\u2019t! You can wear anything from boyfriend-style pajamas to French maid costumes, so don\u2019t be afraid to choose something unique to you.\n2. Choose flowery white lace for the classic feminine look. If you want to go a traditional route, find a comfortable white or cream bra and panty set made from sheer flowery lace. Or go with a short white lacy gown. Some lingerie combines lace and faux-fur for an extra feminine touch.\n3. Try an artsy corset with suspenders, stockings, and heels for a bolder approach. If bold is more your style, think straps! Look for a detailed, beaded or embroidered corset with suspenders, fishnet or lace thigh-highs, and a pair of matching heels. Choose any color theme you like for this lingerie based on your preference. Some corsets have a connected underwear component with suspenders; others don\u2019t, in which case, you can find a matching thong to complete your outfit.\n4. Choose a lacy jumpsuit or teddie if you like one-pieces. Find a lacy halter mini-shorts jumpsuit to combine sporty and feminine looks. Or go bold and feminine with a sheer or strappy teddie in any color that you like. To stay on the more traditional side, choose white or cream for your one-piece lingerie. Or choose a pastel pink or blue for a romantic, feminine effect. Black or red also work well with these pieces if you want a bolder look.\n5. Get a sheer dressing gown for some added luxury. Regardless of what style lingerie you get, consider a sheer dressing gown to drape over it, as an extra piece to remove on your wedding night, for lounging around in the morning, or both.\n6. Consider a separate registry just for lingerie if you\u2019re having trouble deciding. If you like too many pieces to choose, let a few close friends and your fianc\u00e9 choose for you! Create a registry online with a lingerie store, add some of your favorite pieces, and give your bridesmaids and fianc\u00e9 the link before your bridal shower. This gives the people who know you best a chance to help you decide. You may end up with more than one item, but that\u2019s okay. Choose one for your wedding night and save the rest for your honeymoon!\n\n\n## Consider your body type\n\n1. Choose strappy lingerie on a muscular frame. You can probably pull off some pretty daring looks if you\u2019re in good shape. Choose lingerie with lots of straps, bold colors, or a cinched waistline to show it off.\n2. Try a plunging neckline and briefs if you\u2019re pear-shaped. Pear-shaped women are smaller up top with wider hips, butt, and thighs. Show off this type of figure with pieces that go low at the neckline and brief-style underwear. Or experiment with colors by wearing bold, bright patterns up top.\n3. Go with v-cut panties and a full coverage bra or corset if you\u2019re apple-shaped. Apple-shaped ladies carry more weight in the top half of their bodies and have slender legs. Show off this type of body by providing full bust coverage and concealing your stomach area, if you want to. Think lots of lace up top and brightly colored panties.\n4. Try a garter belt or any waist-cincher for an hourglass figure. Hourglass figures have a proportioned build with bust and thigh measurements that are about equal, and are slimmer at the waist. Show off your waistline with a flattering belt or any accessory that draws attention to it.\n5. Go wireless for a small bust. If you don\u2019t need an underwire bra on your wedding day, don\u2019t bother with one. Try a feminine lacy bralette or a racerback style bra if you have a small chest. You can likely find some cute halter one-pieces as well.\n6. Choose high-waisted bottoms for a long torso. If you have a long torso and shorter legs, you can choose from the variety of high-waisted styles that are so popular. Try a lacy crop top set with high-waisted bottoms to draw more attention to your shoulders and legs.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to create a custom list on imdb?","response":"If your IMDb Watchlist doesn't cut it for the information you want to save, you may want to set up a custom list. IMDb allows you to make these custom lists from their app or their website.\n\n## Via the imdb mobile app\n\n1. Open the IMDb app. IMDb can be found in the iPhone and Android app store. The icon may either be yellow with black lettering or clear with yellow lettering: this will differ from operating system to operating system.\n2. Try and view your current custom lists. Tap the person icon to the right of the search box; then tap the \"Your Lists\" option from between the Your Check-Ins and Your History options of your Watchlist options page. To get here on a tablet such as an iPad or Android tablet, instead, choose the hamburger menu to the left of the search bar at the top of the screen and choose \"Your lists.\"\n3. Tap \"Create a list\". This can be found up near the top of the screen, underneath the feature telling you how many lists you have and how they are sorted. It's just above all your current IMDb lists.\n4. Designate whether the list will be private or not. If you want it to be private, make sure the slider switch remains green. If you want it public, tap or slide the green slider switch to turn off the privatized settings for this new list.\n5. Tap the \"New list title\" label line and enter a new title for the custom list. When you've finished naming it, tap the \"Done\" button.\n6. Describe why you created the list. If there's a theme to the list, use this option to remind yourself what the purpose is. There is no true \"Done\" button, but you can proceed to the next step to finish the process instead; Return just line-advances to a new line below the current one.\n7. Tap the \"Save\" button in the top right corner of the screen.\n8. Stock the list with some initial content. Tap the list you just created. Tap the \"Add to List\" option. Type the title. The tool will begin searching for items you can add to the list. If by the end of the search the title just doesn't come up, you can press the Search button on your keyboard. Tap the item to add to list.\n9. Repeat for additional titles to add. Tap the + sign to the right of (1 title) instead for each successive addition.\n\n\n## Via the website\n\n1. Log in to the IMDb website in your web browser. Once you get to the website, you'll click either the \"Sign in with Facebook\" or \"Other sign in options\" buttons or links near the top right corner of the page; you can sign in via Facebook, Google, or Amazon, or you can create an IMDb account. Then you'll have free range to add stuff to your Watchlist at any time.\n2. Hover over your name near the right hand corner and click \"Your Lists\". This will take you to the page containing all your lists, including your Watchlist and list of check-ins. If you already have other lists, this page will also display these other lists by title only.\n3. Click the \"Create a New List\" button over on the right-hand side.\n4. Name your list. Click into the \"List Title\" field and type your name for the list. This is one of two mandatory fields to create the list.\n5. Describe your list. Click into the \"List Description\" box and type a description for the list.\n6. Tell IMDb what types of items you are planning to save in this list. On the IMDb mobile site, the types of Items is pre-populated. On the website, you have to choose one item from the drop-down list: your choices include: \"Titles\", \"People\" and \"Images\".\n7. Click the \"Create\" button once you are done.\n8. Click in the text box to the right of \"Add a movie or TV show to this list\".\n9. Search for the item, based on IMDb labeling and formatting and click the item once it appears.

{"instruction":"How to hook up with an ex girlfriend?","response":"## Get ready to hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Keep it spontaneous. If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up. If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.\n2. Let enough time pass. If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated. Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her. Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.\n3. Let her know you want to hook up. Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too. Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot. Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.\n4. Make your intentions clear. Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up. Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.\n5. Make sure you're on the same page. Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it. Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more? Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two. Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?\n\n\n## Hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Make sure you only hook up. Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her. Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.\n2. Hook up sparingly. Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week. Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?\n3. Don't get too comfortable. It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable. No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.\n4. Stay in control. If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free. This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.\n5. Keep your new relationship private. Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you. If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship. If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.\n6. Avoid \"lovey dovey\" stuff when you're hooking up. Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, \"He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,\" or \"He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.\" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her. You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.\n\n\n## Know when to stop hook up\n\n1. Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again. Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings. If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave. If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out. If you have to end the \"relationship\" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.\n2. Stop if one of you starts liking someone else. If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings. If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time. If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.\n3. Stop when you've fallen into a routine. Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over. You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.\n4. Stop if you start fighting like a couple. As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, \"Where is this taking us?\" or \"What does all of this mean?\" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right? It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.\n5. Stop if you're no longer having fun. The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended. Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to pay residential at&amp;t bills?","response":"AT&T has expanded to include landline, cell phone, Internet, and television services. However, you can access your account and pay the bill for all of your services through the website or the customer service telephone system.\n\n## Set up an online payment account with at&t\n\n1. Create a \"MyAT&T\" account. Whether you have residential phone service, cell phone service, Internet, U-Verse, or DirecTV, you can manage everything through a single log-in at the AT&T website at https:\/\/www.att.com. Select your account type. The typical residential customer will fall under either \"U-verse TV, Internet & Voice,\" or \"Home Phone, Internet & Digital TV.\" U-verse is the newest AT&T innovation delivered through an upgraded fiber-optic network and is not available in all states. Enter the account number from your statement or the phone number associated with your account. The final information needed to set up your account is the billing zip code. Enter an ID name for your account and password. Your password should be at least 8 characters and include a mix of upper and lower case letters and numbers. Confirm your account. For security purposes, you will receive an email with instructions on how to confirm your account.\n2. Access your bill. Once you log in to your account, click on the tab marked \"Billing, Usage, Payments.\" In the drop down menu, select \"Bill Details.\" You can view a bill summary or download and print a copy of the paper bill.\n3. Make a payment. You have two choices for making a payment. You can either use a debit\/credit card or have the payment debited out of your bank account. In the field marked \"Select Payment Method,\" you will be taken to the page where you can enter the details of your payment method. Once your payment details are entered, you will be given the opportunity to store it for use with future payments.\n4. Establish an Auto-Pay schedule. Under the payments tab, you can select \"Manage Auto-Pay\" to authorize the payment to be automatically deducted from your bank account on the same day every month. For security purposes, be sure to log out and close your browser window after making an online payment.\n\n\n## Pay your at&t bill by mail\n\n1. Review your statement. Either log into your MyAT&T account and print out the bill you want to pay or use the statement you received in the mail. The statement will include the amount you owe, details about the bill, and the payment due date. If you are unable to print your bill, note the account number on your check, and include a note with your name, address, and phone number associated with the account.\n2. Pay by check or money order. You can pay your bill by either personal check or money order. Because of security concerns and lack of a receipt, do not mail cash.\n3. Assemble your payment. You can either use the envelope provided with your monthly bill or hand address an envelope. Put your return address in the upper left corner and add the AT&T payment mailing address. Affix proper first class postage and your payment is ready to mail. You can verify the payment address on the AT&T website under the \"Support\" tab. The current address is: AT&T U-verse, P.O. Box 5014, Carol Stream, IL, 60197.\n\n\n## Use other at&t payment options\n\n1. Pay your bill via the automated phone system. Dial 1-800-288-2020 to access the 24 hour-a-day telephone customer service system. You will be asked to confirm the phone number associated with your account. You may also be asked for the last four digits of you Social Security number, and your zip code to verify your account. Follow the prompts to pay your bill. The system is voice-activated. You can either enter your information by voice or through the keypad on your phone. Speak slowly and clearly. There is no service charge to make a payment through the automated system.\n2. Speak with a customer service representative. Once you have verified your phone number, the phone system will ask you what you would like to do. Say \"representative\" and your call will be transferred to an operator to complete your payment. You may be assessed a $5 charge to have the operator process your payment.\n3. Use one of the authorized payment locations. You can search for a business that is authorized by AT&T to accept your payment in person. These agent locations can accept payment by cash, check, or money order. Payment locations cannot accept credit card payments. You can search for a pay station either by zip code or by city and state. Pay stations may charge a convenience fee of $2 to $5 to process your payment. You will need your account number to pay at a payment location. You may be asked to show photo identification.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"AT&T has expanded to include landline

{"instruction":"How to resolve complaints?","response":"When a customer has a grievance with a company, it is in the interests of both parties to come to a smooth and fast resolution. Whether you are the one making a complaint or the one designated to resolve customer service issues, you can make the process an easy one that will keep everybody happy.\n\n## Make a successful complaint against a company\n\n1. Determine what the exact problem is. A complaint can be a very minor matter (such as if you buy a shirt that has a tear in it) or a very significant--even criminal--matter (such as if you are defrauded out of a significant amount of money). Consider carefully what exactly your complaint entails. Some common reasons to make a complaint include:\n\t* Buying a defective product\n\t* Ordering a product that is not delivered in a timely fashion\n\t* Being charged the wrong price for a purchase\n\t* Having your credit card information stolen and used improperly\n2. Figure out what you want to achieve with your complaint. Depending on the severity of your complaint, you might wish to achieve very different goals. Ask yourself what would solutions would make you happy. You might also want to consider whether the company can take any action that would make you want to return as a customer. Keep your ideal goal in mind as you pursue your claim. Some possible solutions to a complaint include:\n\t* Getting a replacement product\n\t* Having your money partially or entirely refunded\n\t* Receiving store credit\n\t* Being paid restitution or damages\n3. Know your rights as a consumer. As a consumer, you have the right to be treated in a fair and above-board manner. Many municipalities and nations have laws that protect consumers from fraudulent behavior. Examine your consumer rights carefully to prepare yourself for a confrontation with the company. If you know your rights, you are less likely to be intimidated into withdrawing your complaint.\n4. Read your paperwork carefully. Many services and products involve a signed contract. This contract might include information about how grievances can be filed and about what grievances are legitimate. Make sure you understand clearly what you have signed your name to and what the company has agreed to. If you are uncertain whether a contract you have signed is legitimate or not, you might contact a consumer attorney who can help you navigate the legalese.\n5. Find the contact information for the appropriate employee at the company. Many companies have a department devoted to customer service. If you have a problem with a product, you will likely want to get in touch with that department. Other possibilities might include management, an Ombudsman (if you feel like you have been mistreated), or human resources (if you suffered abuse at the hands of an employee). Look through the company website or navigate their voicemail system to determine whom you should contact.\n6. Gather all relevant material and information. Before you make your complaint, make sure you have all the necessary paperwork and dates at your disposal. Many companies require a proof of purchase before exchanging or returning items, and you will want to have yours handy. If your transaction involved a transaction number, be sure you have that written down in a handy place. Things you might gather include:\n\t* A copy of your receipt\n\t* Your credit card slip\n\t* Your credit card bill with the relevant transaction on it\n\t* Your emailed transaction confirmation\n\t* The date and time of your transaction\n\t* Your warranty\n\t* The defective item\n7. Make copies of your paperwork. Before handing any documents over to the company, make sure that you have back-up copies safely stored at home. This is especially important for receipts and contracts: never give up your originals until your complaint is resolved. You should also document your phone calls: jot down the time you called, the people to whom you spoke, and the details of your conversation.\n8. Try a phone call or quick visit first. Especially for minor complaints, you can try to resolve your complaint with a quick phone call or visit to the appropriate employee. Many retail stores have a customer service desk you can visit, for example. If your complaint is small and does not involve potentially criminal activity on the part of the company, try to resolve the issue in this quick and easy way.\n9. Communicate your grievance clearly and succinctly. Be upfront, polite, but firm when you articulate your complaint to the customer service representative. Make sure that you detail exactly what your problem is, the date of your transaction, and how you envision the problem might be resolved. Try to avoid extreme emotions or oversharing at this stage: after all, you want the customer service representative to be on your side. For example, you might say:\n\t* \"I purchased this new phone last week. Unfortunately, the phone battery does not hold its charge. According to my warranty, I should receive a brand-new phone. Can you help me resolve this?\" \"I bought these earrings on October 19. I was told that they were hypoallergenic. However, they are still causing an allergic reaction. I am hoping to exchange them for actually hypoallergenic earrings. I have kept my receipt and credit card slip.\" \"When I came in to the store yesterday, your sales clerk named John made an insulting remark about my appearance. I am very concerned since I visit your shop quite often and have been a loyal customer. I would like to file a grievance with your company.\"\n10. Control your temper. Even if you are feeling very frustrated, it is best to remain calm and polite at this stage. Resist the urge to yell or use insulting language. Some tips for controlling your anger include:\n\t* Taking deep breaths. Avoiding hyperbole and keeping your problem in perspective. Focusing on solving the problem. Communicating clearly.\n11. Use \"I\" statements to express your frustration. \"I\" statements are an effective way to express yourself without appearing to blame or take your anger out on someone. In an \"I\" statement, you simply state how you feel in first-person terms. For example, you might state:\n\t* \"I am disappointed in the quality of this product\" instead of \"Your company made a terrible product.\" \"I am frustrated that the delivery did not occur on time\" instead of \"Your delivery driver sucks.\" \"I hope that we can come to a resolution\" instead of \"You had better make this right.\"\n12. Do not lose sight of your goal. Sometimes a company might offer you a solution that is not quite what you had hoped for. For example, they might offer you store credit when what you want is a refund. Or they might only offer you a product repair instead of a new product. Consider whether what they offer you initially is fair. If not, hold firm about what you wanted to achieve through your complaint. Do not give in right away: be persistent and see if you can achieve your goal.\n13. Express your gratitude if your complaint is resolved. Many companies will attempt to help you at this stage by refunding your money, replacing your product, or giving you store credit. If this was your ideal solution, then you have effectively solved your complaint. Thank the customer service representative for his efforts. If the representative went above and beyond his duties, you might also write a letter of appreciation to his superior to express your happiness at his performance. If you are ignored or if your ideal solutions are not met at this stage, however, you might have to take further action.\n14. Follow up on the resolution. When both parties have agreed to a solution, give the other party ample time to implement it. After a fair amount of time, call them back to verify that the solution has been put in place. If they have been able to honestly and fairly assist you, they\u2019ll be glad to be able to give you the good news of your problem\u2019s resolution. If not, then you might want to consider contacting management or bringing in a third party.\n15. Turn to social media if you are being ignored. In some cases, a customer service representative may not be helpful or might refuse your call. In a case like this, social media can help draw attention to your plight and cause the company to begin working on your behalf. Consider writing a public Facebook post that links to the company's Facebook page or composing a Tweet directed at the company. This might help your voice be heard.\n16. Take your complaint to management if necessary. If you do not have any luck with customer service, consider talking to someone in a management or supervisory position. Be sure that you mention the steps you tried to take to resolve the issue before now and how disappointed you are in how you have been treated. If you get a supervisor's attention, you might be able to get the attention you deserve.\n17. Express your complaint in writing. At this stage, you will want to communicate with the company in writing. Writing conveys a sense of seriousness and also creates a paper trail that can help you pursue your complaint. Use a business letter format in order to write a letter of complaint. You can find a sample complaint letter here: https:\/\/www.usa.gov\/complaint-letter. Keep a copy of your letter for your files. Be sure to include photocopies of relevant supporting documents such as receipts, credit slips, warranties, or contracts as evidence for your case.\n18. Get in touch with a consumer rights agency if necessary. If the complaints has not been resolved to your satisfaction yet, you might need to bring in a third party. There are many governmental and nonprofit agencies that exist to protect consumers and to regulate business practices. Some examples of these agencies include the Better Business Bureau, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Trade Commission. Many of these agencies allow you to submit a grievance through a simple online form. If you are located in the United States, you can find your local consumer protection agency using this web address: https:\/\/www.usa.gov\/state-consumer\n\t* \n\t* The Better Business Bureau provides an online form you can use to file a complaint here: https:\/\/www.bbb.org\/consumer-complaints\/file-a-complaint\/nature-of-complaint\/\n\t* \n\t* If your complaint is regarding a financial institution or transaction (such as a line of credit), get in touch with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: http:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/complaint\/\n\t* \n\t* If your complaint has to do with fraud or identity theft, you can get in touch with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/consumers\/assistance\/protection\/index.html\n19. Contact the relevant licensing board. Many businesses are required to maintain a license with a local or national board. For example, doctors, restaurants, salons, and optometrists often need to maintain their standing with a licensing board. If your complaint is serious, you might consider contacting a representative of the licensing board to let them know of your concerns.\n20. Contact the government about fraud or abuse. If you think you have been the victim of a crime, you should contact the governmental authorities. Your complaint might help them prevent future scams and thefts. If you have been scammed, defrauded, or had your identity stolen, your complaint is serious enough to involve the state and is too serious for the company to handle internally.\n21. Go to small claims court to retrieve money. Small claims courts allow you to sue for small amounts of money--usually under $10,000. This amount is not worth the cost of most litigation proceedings, but small-claims courts provide a simple and inexpensive way to try to recoup your funds. Some of the most common cases in small claims courts are breaches of warranty or breaches of contract. Visit this website to determine the small-claims limit in your state if you live in the United States: http:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/types-cases-for-small-claims-court-29918.html\n22. Report your complaint publicly. Make sure that other potential customers are aware of serious issues with how a company does business. Provide an honest, objective review with consumer protection websites and publicly viewable review sites to ensure that others do not encounter the same problems you did. Alternatively, if your complaint was resolved in a quick and professional manner, you can leave a positive review with these sites and agencies to reward the company for their good work.\n\n\n## Resolve a complaint from a customer\n\n1. Remember that complaints are useful tools for your company. Do not resent a complaint from a customer. Consider complaints to be a free source of feedback on how your company is viewed by its patrons. Resist the urge to be angry, resentful, or grouchy at a complaining customer: instead, be grateful that they are making you aware of a potential problem with how you conduct business. A business's reputation depends less on the number of complaints they receive and more on how fairly and professionally they handle those complaints.\n2. Acknowledge their complaint quickly. A key to excellent customer service is responding as quickly as possible to a complaint. Get back to email complaints, complaints left over voicemail, or written complaints within two business days if at all possible. Even if you have not yet come up with a solution, you should let your customer know that you are working on it and that you have heard their concerns. Solving their complaint quickly will please your customer and will also save your company valuable time and energy. Try not to have complaints lead to multiple conversations or contacts: resolve all complaints on the spot if at all possible.\n3. Express your gratitude. Thank your customer for their patience, their business, and for taking the time to notify you of an issue. Your goal is not to make the customer disappear but rather to please the customer enough that she will continue using your goods and services.\n4. Listen actively. Use active listening techniques to make sure that you understand your customer's complaint and that they feel like they are being heard. Do not dismiss or ignore what they say: give them your full attention. Active listening involves:\n\t* Making eye contact\n\t* Nodding and using other affirming body language\n\t* Not getting distracted\n\t* Asking follow-up questions to make sure you understand them fully\n5. Apologize for their trouble. Do not blame the customer or avoid your own responsibility. Instead, apologize clearly and directly for your customer's problem. They will appreciate it, and an apology is a first step in approaching a resolution to make you and your customer happy. It is especially effective if you pair an apology with the beginnings of a proactive solution. You might say:\n\t* \"I am so sorry for your frustration. Let's work together to solve this matter.\" \"I would like to apologize on behalf of the company that your product never arrived. I will make sure that you receive a replacement shortly.\" \"I absolutely understand your frustration, and I am sorry for any trouble we might have caused. How can we make this better for you?\"\n6. Follow company grievance resolution procedure. Most large companies have policies to resolve the most common customer complaints such as defective products, undelivered products, or delayed services. Ideally the procedure should be one that protects the interest of both the customer and the company by weeding out illegitimate complaints and by granting customers recompense if their complaints is legitimate. It is easiest for you and your customer if you have a grievance procedure that is fair, simple, and fast. Technology can be very helpful in this regard: a website where customers can file complaints will make it easier for you and for them to reach a mutually beneficial solution.\n7. Implement the solution immediately. An immediate solution to a complaint can improve customer loyalty by 25%. Try to eliminate delays in refunding your customer's money, replacing their product, or giving them store credit. Make it possible for your staff members to undertake these transactions on the spot and in the store if possible. Common solutions include:\n\t* Refunding their money\n\t* Allowing them to exchange their product\n\t* Redelivering a delayed product\n\t* Redoing a service that was improperly done the first time, free of charge\n\t* Giving them store credit and future discounts\n8. Hire courteous, competent customer service employees. These jobs are an important part of maintaining your customer base and keeping up goodwill. Make sure that your customer service employees are problem-solvers who do not anger easily. Moreover, give them the leeway to solve customer grievance procedures on their own if possible: give them the power to resolve complaints on their own without referring customers to management. This will empower your customers and eliminate time delays.\n9. Follow up with your customer. A week or so after you have implemented the resolution, get in touch with your customer to see whether they are now satisfied. This is a great opportunity to apologize once again for their trouble and to thank them for their business. Hopefully they are now happy and will continue doing business with you.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Remind yourself that you can start back to work at a slow pace and catch up on your own time.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to save money when traveling with kids?","response":"Traveling with kids can be a fun and exciting for the whole family. It can also be expensive, especially if you want to travel overseas or across the country. Between transportation, accommodations, and excursions, you may worry how you will be able to afford to travel with kids and ensure everyone has a good time. To save money when travelling with kids, focus on cheaper transportation options and affordable accommodations. You can also plan excursions and activities that will be affordable and fun for all.\n\n## Choose cheaper transportation options\n\n1. Drive rather than fly. To save money on transportation costs, consider planning an old fashioned road trip with the kids. The price of gas will likely be cheaper than paying for multiple plane tickets, especially if you have a large family. Try to travel with at least two people who can drive so you can drive in shifts, especially if the drive will be long. To keep the peace in the backseat while on the road trip, make sure you bring lots of snacks and games for the kids. Keep them occupied with music and singalongs in the car. This way, you can all travel in peace, cheaply.\n2. Use points to book cheaper flights. If you do want to fly to your destination as a family, be sure to use any points or reward miles that you have accumulated to book your plane tickets. Set up a rewards system for air travel through your credit card or through a rewards card for a specific airline. Always check to see if you can use points to reduce the cost of plane tickets or to get better deals on flights. You should also do your research on possible flight options so you can find the cheapest one. Compare flight prices online. Watch for flight deals and book them right away so you get a more affordable price.\n3. Consider taking the train. If train travel is an option, look into train prices to see if it will be affordable. You can often buy rail passes that you can use for many days at a time and there is usually cheaper family pricing. Train travel may be a good option if you are planning to travel across the country, such as within Europe or within a specific area in the U.S. Some train passes also cover admission to certain attractions and excursions in the area you are travelling to. This may be a good option if you want to also save money on attractions for the whole family during your trip.\n4. Take public transit as a family. Public transit, such as buses, light rail, and trams, are ideal if you want to save money when traveling with kids. Get a public transit pass as a family and use it to get around, especially if you are traveling to major cities or destinations. Often, public transit can be a great way to interact with the locals and see different areas from the comfort of your seat. Most public transit passes can be purchased by day or for multiple days. They are often $10 or less, depending on where you are travelling.\n\n\n## Select affordable accommodations\n\n1. Travel during the off-season or shoulder-season. Travelling during the off-season can make your travel expenses more affordable, especially transportation and accommodation costs. Going on your trip during the off-season, usually the fall months, will make hotels and other accommodations cheaper than during peak season. Consider booking your trip during the off-season or during shoulder-season, the time between peak and off-peak. For example, if you\u2019re planning a trip to Walt Disney World, the shoulder-season is May and September, where crowds are thinner and accommodations are more affordable.\n2. Book a home share or a rental property. Finding cheap accommodations when you have kids can be a challenge, especially if you want a space larger than a hotel room. Consider renting a house through online rental property sites. Often, a home rental will have an affordable nightly rate or week by week rate. Having a home rental will also help you to also save money by cooking your own meals and not having to pay for parking, if the home rental has a parking spot already. A home share, where you share a home with other people or another family, can also be an affordable option. You may travel with family and friends and share a large home rental together to cut down on costs.\n3. Use hotel points to book a hotel. If you decide to stay in a hotel while travelling, use hotel points to make it more affordable. Collect points over time through your credit card or another rewards card and use the points to reduce your hotel rates. Try to book a hotel during off-season or shoulder-season so you get a more affordable rate. Sometimes booking a hotel during the week instead of the weekend can be a cheaper option. You can also try looking online for deals on hotels and book it before you leave on your trip. Often rates are cheaper online and booking in advance may save you money.\n4. Go for a family travel package that includes accommodations. If you are traveling to a destination that is known to be popular with kids and families, such as Disneyland, look for travel packages. Travel packages often include airfare and accommodations at a reduced rate. This could be a good way for you to save money and not have to worry about booking your own accommodations, as it is included in the package. If you are travelling to a tropical destination, such as Mexico, you may look into travel packages where you stay at a family friendly resort. Resort packages often include airfare and accommodations.\n5. See if you can stay with friends or family. To really save money on accommodations, see if you can all stay with friends or family who live near your destination. You may plan a trip to see friends or family members who have larger homes where you can all stay together. Or you may set up a blow up mattress that you can then use when staying with family or friends to make your accommodations very cheap.\n\n\n## Plan affordable excursions and activities\n\n1. Book excursions in advance to save money. Do your research and make a list of excursions you want to go to with the kids. Then, book these excursions in advance, if possible. Often, booking excursions in advance can get you a cheaper rate. It will also put less stress on you to figure out things to do once you arrive at your destination. You should also check for family pricing when booking excursions. Often, booking excursions as a group or a family can make them cheaper.\n2. Find free, fun activities for the kids. Excursions can be expensive, even with family pricing. To save money, look for free, fun activities for your kids. Research activities online in the area you are staying in, focusing on those that are free or very cheap. Come up with a fun, free activity for the kids to do while you are traveling. For example, you may book a free tour of the city you are staying in for you and the kids. Or you may take the kids to a play area at the resort you are staying in for free activities. You can also bring books and games from home with you on the trip so the kids have things to do while in the car or in the hotel.\n3. Bring snacks and light meals on excursions. To save money during excursions and activities, make sure you pack snacks and light meals. This way, if your kids get hungry, you have snacks on hand and can avoid eating out all the time. Buy snacks in bulk when you get to your destination. Prepare a few light meals that travel well and bring them when you are out for the day with the kids. For example, healthy snacks like nuts, sliced fruit, and granola bars are all good options. Light meals like sandwiches, mini yogurts, and sliced vegetables are also good for travel.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make the most of your physical therapy?","response":"## Physical therapy payments\n\n1. Ask your doctor to recommend the best physical therapist for your condition. Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.\n2. Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered. Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.\n3. Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket. Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.\n\n\n## Physical therapy sessions\n\n1. Have a positive attitude toward physical therapy. Will power and optimism during a recovery are almost as important as doctor's care. Your commitment to the exercises will have a direct correlation to the swiftness and completeness of your recovery.\n2. Wear athletic shoes and loose-fitting, flexible clothing to all physical therapy sessions. If you have to go to your session straight from work, then keep spare exercise clothing in your bag or car. This type of clothing allows you the full range of motion in your exercises and keeps your regular clothes clear of analgesic creams or massage oils.\n3. Drink plenty of water while you are exercising. Although this is a general rule, it is even more important when you are healing from an injury. Stay hydrated throughout the day and bring a water bottle to your session.\n4. Show up early to each appointment. Your physical therapist may allow you to warm up before the session, on a machine or by stretching. This also makes certain that you are never late, because you will be charged for the session from the moment your appointment time arrives. Make sure to be 15 minutes early for your first appointment. You will need to fill out insurance and health forms. Bring a list of your medications and other current treatments.\n5. Discuss your goals with your physical therapist at your first meeting. Pain and injury are different for everyone, so you must make it clear whether you want to return to work, get rid of pain, walk without weight supports or run a marathon. Tell the physical therapist how many sessions you can afford, so the plan can be adjusted for what you will do during your sessions and what you can continue at home. Remember that this may need to be adjusted on the future, based on your progress. In most cases, the harder you work doing prescribed exercises at home, the fewer office sessions you will need to have.\n6. Ask your physical therapist to give you a list of prescribed exercises, with diagrams. They should establish what and when you should be doing each exercise, so that you are clear about your \"homework.\" Ask the physical therapist to show you each exercise as well as having you do repetitions in the office.\n7. Tell your physical therapist whenever something is painful. Mistakes can be made if you do not communicate properly about your pain levels. The physical therapist can also tell you what pain is natural to the healing process and what is unnatural, allowing the exercises to be adjusted.\n8. Ask to be treated by the same physical therapist every time. This provides consistency, familiarity and a greater chance that you will be able to accomplish your goals.\n9. Ask plenty of questions. You must be proactive about your treatment. If you don't understand why you are doing something or how you should do something, you are more likely to refrain from the exercise and fail to progress.\n10. Report your progress at the beginning of each physical therapy session. Make sure you tell your therapist any new pain or problems, as well as your positive progress. They will usually write this on your chart to ensure you won't have complications from the regime.\n11. Leave your cell phone and personal problems at the door when you go to physical therapy. You must use this valuable time to focus on health and your body. You may need to learn to recognize your body's warning signs, which is hard to do when you are distracted.\n\n\n## Physical therapy at home\n\n1. Create a schedule to do your physical therapy exercises at home. Do not leave it up to chance whether you have the time or not. They are as important as doctor-prescribed medicine and should be treated as a priority during your day.\n2. Set aside a space to do physical therapy. Keep a corner of your home ready with a yoga mat or exercise ball, so that you can do a few repetitions when you have some free time. This will help you get into the mentality of exercise as a lifestyle choice.\n3. Take the prescribed therapy exercises seriously. If you are advised to do them once per day, do them every day, and if you are asked to do them 3 times per day, do them 3 times per day. Frequent exercises are usually prescribed when there is a limited time for you to regain your mobility during the healing process, and they should be treated with gravity.\n4. Progress to more repetitions or sets as you get stronger. Many physical therapists will tell you to add 5 repetitions or 1 more set when the exercise becomes easy. You may also be asked to add more weight to your exercises.\n5. Ask the physical therapist for an appropriate regimen to continue after you no longer attend sessions. They should be able to adjust an exercise regime according to your particular health problems. Establish goals that you should reach 3 months, 6 months and a year into the future.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make a paper mosaic?","response":"Mosaics were traditionally made with bits of tile or glass, but it is possible to make simple ones using paper. They are a great project for school children to do while learning about different cultures throughout history. They are also a great project to do on a rainy day or over summer vacation. You can make paper mosaic masterpieces to frame and hang. You can also make paper mosaic masks to wear!\n\n## Make a simple paper mosaic\n\n1. Get some sheets of paper in different colors. Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.\n2. Cut the paper into small pieces to make your tiles. The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners. Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n3. Start gluing the pieces of paper to the outline of a shape. Lightly draw a simple shape on a sheet of paper, which will be the outline for your mosaic. When you start gluing the pieces on it, leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline\u2014otherwise, your shape will look jagged. If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy. If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast.\n4. Glue the rest of your tiles to the inside of your shape. If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in. Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit! For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.\n5. Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color. This will make your work stand out. If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus. You can also leave the background blank.\n6. Set the mosaic out to dry. If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.\n7. Finished.\n\n\n## Make a paper mosaic mask\n\n1. Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper. The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet. Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.\n2. Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth. You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!\n3. Cut some colored paper into small tiles. You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail. You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth. For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out. Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.\n4. Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask. Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.\n5. Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth. This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape. Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.\n6. Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired. Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.\n7. Start filling in your mask with tiles. You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile. Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.\n8. Let your mask dry. If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.\n9. Cut the mask and the eyes out. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.\n10. Punch some holes to either side of the mask, and thread some ribbon or elastic through them. The holes should be at about ear level, or just where the eyes are on your mask. This will make the mask more comfortable to wear.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to slow down as a busy traveler?","response":"## Prepare for low-stress travel\n\n1. Prepare a packing list ahead of time. Packing your bags can be one of the most frantic and stressful aspects of travel\u2013not to mention one that\u2019s often left until the last minute. To slow down this aspect of your traveling, create a packing list months in advance of your trip. Write down travel necessities (clothes, passport, computer) first, and add new items to the list when they come to mind. Don\u2019t throw away your list after you return from your trip. A well-made travel list can serve you for years, since you\u2019ll typically take the same items with you from one trip to the next. Consider laminating your packing list and placing it in your suitcase or backpack, so you won\u2019t have to search for it each time you\u2019re planning a new trip.\n2. Pack well in advance, and travel light. To slow down the speed of your travel preparation and to avoid stress, start packing in advance. Although some items\u2014such as clothes and toiletries\u2014may need to be packed the day before you leave, others can be set aside weeks in advance. This will allow you to pack more slowly, and decrease travel-associated stress. As a busy traveler, it\u2019s also important that you travel light. This will help you move with less stress through busy airports, security lines, and bus terminals. Packing light will also help you focus on the places you\u2019re traveling to see, as you won\u2019t be weighed down by several heavy bags. Only focus on bringing the essentials; you can always pick up incidental objects on your trip.\n3. Consider booking through a travel agent. Especially if you\u2019re planning a long trip\u2014or several short trips\u2014with multiple destinations, hotel stays, rental cars, and other logistics, plan to talk with a travel agent. Although the profession may seem outdated, an agent can put together all of these bookings for you, so that you\u2019re not searching through countless travel websites on your own time. For long, complex trips, working with a travel agent could also save you money. Your travel agent may be able to find lucrative deals that you wouldn\u2019t have access to, or may know ways to package flight, hotel, and rental car purchases together to decrease the cost.\n\n\n## Slow down while you\u2019re travel\n\n1. Let the hotel front desk staff do some of the work. A large part of the headache of fast-paced travel comes from the plethora of details that can consume your time and generate stress. Rather than micro-managing each detail yourself, seek assistance from the front-desk staff or hotel concierge. For example, ask the front desk of your hotel to make you a dinner reservation, call you a cab, or put together an outline of a travel plan for a day. Especially if you\u2019re traveling with children, you\u2019ll need to rely on others around you to make your trip less stressful and busy. Ask the front desk staff for restaurant recommendations, and recommendations of local activities that are fun for children.\n2. Schedule in \u201crequired\u201d extra time for delays. As a busy traveler, you\u2019ll often have a tight schedule to keep: flight times, bus schedules, and train timetables may be your first priority. However, delays are an unfortunate but inevitable part of travel. Slow down your travel schedule by allowing extra time around all plane, bus, and train travel, and you\u2019ll find yourself feeling less busy and enjoying your travel time more. By accepting that delays are a part of travel, you can save yourself stress and worry. You can also pan to be productive during your delays\u2014call ahead to alert the hotel that you\u2019ll be arriving late, or if you have a longer delay, walk around a local neighborhood to absorb the culture.\n3. Plan to do fewer activities. This may seem like an intuitive step, but it\u2019s one that many busy travelers forget. Rather than filling your time when you\u2019re traveling with a dozen plans, which will leave you feeling rushed and drained, simplify your trip and only do the three or four activities that you\u2019re most excited about. For example, if a city is known for its world-class art museum but you\u2019d rather spend the day exploring a local forest, don\u2019t feel obliged to do both. Stick with the forest. Filling your time with fewer activities\u2014but ones that are more interesting, pleasurable, and meaningful to you as an individual\u2014will help you slow down your travel pace. This will allow you to savor and enjoy each activity more.\n\n\n## Use slow-paced travel methods\n\n1. Slow down your method of travel by staying on the ground. If you\u2019re used to traveling primarily by plane\u2014a fast-paced, high-stress mode of travel\u2014look into alternate options. For example, a road trip is a great way to see local attractions and parts of a country or region that you haven\u2019t visited before. A road trip also allows you to slow down and travel at your own leisurely pace. If you\u2019ve never traveled by train, it can be an excellent way to slow down the pace of your travel and have more local-color experiences while traveling. Train travel moves at a leisurely pace, and you won\u2019t have to worry about catching connecting flights or navigating unfamiliar\u2014and stressful\u2014airports.\n2. Take a local approach and travel somewhere nearby. You can also slow down the busy pace of your travel by focusing on in-depth exploration of a single local city, town, or region, rather than traveling across the country or world. Treating your own local environment like a travel destination will allow you to absorb local color that you haven\u2019t noticed before, and you\u2019ll be able to avoid the stressful tourist traps that draw inexperienced travelers in new cities and countries. As long as you\u2019re traveling locally, you can try eating locally too. If there\u2019s a farmer\u2019s market open in the area, do your shopping there; you\u2019ll doubtlessly be surprised by the varieties of local food that you\u2019ve never sampled before. You don\u2019t have to stay in your own house to explore a local area. Look into local AirBnBs, traditional Bed and Breakfasts, and \u201cmom and pop\u201d-type hotel: say, within 30 miles of where you live.\n3. Take an affordable cruise. A cruise offers many conveniences that will help you keep your travel slow paced and not too stressful. The cruise ship will offer you a \u201chome base\u201d to start your daily explorations from, so you won\u2019t have to worry about rushing from hotel to hotel, or from AirBnB to AirBnB. Cruise ships tend to travel at a moderate pace, giving their customers plenty of time to explore local cities and sites. The cruise will also confine you to a single region, which is beneficial to a slow-paced, low-stress travel plan. To book a cruise, first check large travel websites, including Expedia and Priceline. You can also book cruises directly through the websites of large providers, such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruise. If you travel with several family members or friends, the cruise line may offer you a group discount. Cruises can be surprisingly inexpensive, especially if booked for the off season.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to survive an earthquake?","response":"## Take cover indoors\n\n1. Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, if possible. In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, try to quickly move away from anything that could fall and injure you. Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter. Remember the phrase \u201cDrop, Cover, Hold on,\u201d which is the course of action recommended by U.S. and international emergency management organizations.\n2. Drop to your hands and knees under a sturdy table or desk. Look for a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a solid table, that can offer cover from falling objects. Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This is was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner. A doorway doesn't offer much protection from falling or flying objects, which cause the most earthquake-related injuries and deaths.\n3. Protect your head and neck from falling debris. If possible, grab a pillow, sofa cushion, or another object to shield your face and head. If there's nothing nearby to use as a shield, cover your face, head, and neck with your hands and arms. A strong earthquake can kick up clouds of dangerous dust. If this is the case, you should also cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief or an article of clothing.\n4. Remain in your safe spot until the shaking stops. Stay put until the shaking has stopped for 1 or 2 minutes. Remain on guard when you get up, as aftershocks can occur at any time after an earthquake. In the event of an earthquake, you and your family (or coworkers, if you're at work) should meet in a designated safe location. Create an action plan in advance, and head to the designated meeting place once the shaking has stopped. If an aftershock occurs, drop, cover, and hold on until it stops.\n5. Use caution around debris after leaving your shelter. Watch out for broken glass and rubble. If you're not wearing shoes, tread lightly, and be extremely careful not to injure yourself. Grab a pair of heavy-soled shoes and, if you're wearing light clothing, put on a pair of pants and a long-sleeved shirt. In a strong earthquake, remember to cover your mouth to avoid inhaling dust, especially if you have a history of any respiratory diseases. If you're trapped, don't shout, as you'd risk inhaling dust. Instead, send a text or call emergency services, tap on a hard surface, or, if you have one, blow a whistle to alert first responders of your location.\n6. Check for injuries and render aid, if needed. Call emergency services if you or someone nearby are injured and need medical attention. If you know first aid or CPR, administer emergency care as needed. To perform CPR, place one hand over the center of the person's chest, and hold your other hand over the first. Keep your arms straight as you press directly into their chest at a rate of about 100 beats per minute. Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound. Pack the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth and apply firm pressure. If firm pressure doesn't stop the bleeding, use a belt, article of clothing, or bandages to fashion a tourniquet. Wrap the tourniquet 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above the wound toward the torso. For a wound on the thigh, wrap the tourniquet above the wound near the groin to limit the amount of blood flowing from the heart. If someone is seriously injured or unconscious, don't move them unless the building is structurally unsound or they're otherwise in immediate danger.\n7. Inspect the building for structural damage and hazards. Check for cracks in the building's structure, fires, the smell of gas, and damaged wires or electrical appliances. If you believe the building is unsound, evacuate immediately. If possible, and if there's no immediate threat that the building will collapse, respond to any utility hazards. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the main valve outside and call the gas company. Note that a professional will be needed to restore service. Look for signs of electrical damage, including sparks, broken or frayed wires, and burning smells. If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you'd have to step in water to access the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician instead of approaching it yourself. Put out any small fires with a fire extinguisher. If there's a larger fire, call emergency services. Evacuate immediately if there's a fire and you smell gas. Don't drink water from the sink, bathe, or use the toilet until your local authorities have advised that it's safe to do so. Plug the drains in sinks and bathtubs to prevent sewage backflow.\n\n\n## Rid it out in a vehicle\n\n1. Stop in a clear area away from trees, buildings, and other structures. Find an open area and stop your vehicle on the shoulder or side of the road. Get as far away as you can from utility poles, large structures, bridges, and any other potential hazards. Pay attention to surrounding traffic, and stop only when it's safe to do so. Don't stop abruptly, or vehicles to the rear might collide with you.\n2. Set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. The car may jiggle violently during an earthquake, but stay put and try to remain calm. You're safer in a car than outside, since vehicles offer protection from debris and falling objects. Turn on your radio, as channels should be broadcasting emergency broadcast information.\n3. Beware of damaged roads, debris, and other hazards when you continue driving. Listen for reports of road closures or hazards on the emergency broadcast. When the shaking stops, resume driving and keep your eye out for damaged roadways, sinkholes, unsound bridges, and any other potential hazards. If a power line has fallen on your vehicle or you're otherwise unable to travel, stay put. Call emergency services, and wait for first responders.\n\n\n## Stay safe outdoors\n\n1. Move away from buildings, street lights, power lines, and bridges. The most dangerous locations during an earthquake are areas immediately around buildings. As soon as the ground begins shaking, try to get as far away as possible from any nearby structures. Stay low to the ground to keep your balance as you get to a safe spot, and keep your eye out for falling debris. Do not seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. Additionally, look out for sinkholes, open faults, or large holes in the ground.\n2. Crouch down low in a wide open area until the shaking stops. Once you've made your way away from nearby structures, get on your hands and knees and cover your head. See if there are any objects nearby to use as a shield, such as a trash can lid. If none are available, cover your head and neck with your hands and arms. Remain crouched low to the ground in a covered position until the shaking stops.\n3. Watch out for hazards as you assess your surroundings. As you venture out after the earthquake, beware of broken glass, rubble, downed power lines, fallen trees, and any other potential hazards. Check yourself and anyone nearby for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid and call emergency services. Stay away from damaged structures and areas immediately around buildings. Remember that aftershocks may occur. If there's an aftershock, weakened buildings, windows, and architectural details can fall to the ground.\n4. Get to higher ground if you're on the shore or near a dam. If a shaking lasts more than 20 seconds, don't wait for an alarm or warning to flee. Get to ground that's at least 100 ft (30 m) above sea level or 2 mi (3.2 km) from the shore. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, so put distance between yourself and the coast. While a catastrophic failure is unlikely, earthquake damage can cause flooding downstream from a dam. If you live in a flood zone, proceed to higher ground. Check evacuation plans in advance if you live near a dam in an earthquake-prone area.\n\n\n## Prepare for an earthquake\n\n1. Make an emergency supply kit. Keep your supplies in an easily accessible spot, such as a hall closet or garage. Make sure every member of your family knows where your emergency supplies are located. Keep the following items on hand:\n\t* Enough bottled water and non-perishable food to last 3 days. A first aid kit, including gauze, alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, tweezers, ibuprofen or another pain reliever, cotton swabs, anti-diarrhea medication, sanitary napkins, and eyewash. Medications that any members of your family take regularly. A flashlight and extra batteries. Tools, including a screwdriver and adjustable wrench. A whistle, to alert first responders in the event you become trapped. Clothes and blankets. Your pet's food and medication, if you have one.\n2. Create a family survival plan for your home. You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety in the event of an emergency. Instruct every member of your household to drop, cover, and hold on, then to head to a designated meeting location when the shaking stops. Designated spots might be a clearing near your home, a school, community center, or a shelter. Make a plan to reunite ahead of time, as phone service may be limited and should be used only for emergencies. Conduct practice drills every 6 months to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.\n3. Identify safe spots and hazards in each room of your home. Look for tall cabinets, televisions, dressers, bookcases, hanging plants, and other objects that could fall and cause injury. Go room by room with your family members, and note spots that offer protection and those that are potentially dangerous. For example, if there's a heavy desk in your child's bedroom, tell them to take cover under it. Advise them to stay away from their windows and dresser.\n4. Store dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves. Avoid storing heavy objects high up, and install brackets to secure tall furniture to walls. Keep any dangerous items, such as sharp objects, glass, and flammable or toxic substances in locked or low cabinets. Objects such as knives or corrosive liquids can cause serious injury, especially if they fall from a high storage spot during an earthquake.\n5. Take first-aid and CPR classes to become certified. If someone nearby is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a lifesaver. A CPR certification will prepare you to respond if the worst happens. Look online for nearby classes, or check with a local clinic or Red Cross chapter.\n6. Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity, and the gas. Earthquakes can damage utilities and cause flooding, fires, or explosions. If you're not sure how to shut off your utilities, call your service providers for specific instructions. To shut off electricity, turn off individual circuits or fuses at the main box, then turn off the main circuit or fuse. Your gas main should be near your gas meter, but locations vary. Use an adjustable wrench to turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise. Your water main should be at your water meter by the street or sidewalk, but it may be inside your home. Turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise to shut off your water.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to handle poking wires on braces?","response":"Poking wires on braces are a very common  and irritating problem. These can cause sores and small cuts and abrasions on your gums and cheeks. Reducing discomfort is the first goal of dealing with this problem, followed by fixing the wire. While there are some ways you can fix poking wires at home, you should always see your orthodontist or dentist to follow up. In most cases, your orthodontist will want to replace a broken wire or cut any long pieces of wire that are poking you.\n\n## Use orthodontic wax\n\n1. Get some orthodontic wax. Your orthodontist should have supplied you with some when you got your braces. If you have run out, you can buy it at most pharmacies. Orthodontic wax comes in small cases containing long strips of wax. If you cannot find wax at a pharmacy, call your orthodontist for some.\n2. Remove a small amount of wax from one of the wax strips. It should be about the size of a small pea. Roll the small piece of wax between your fingers until it is a smooth ball. Make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching the wax. Use only new, unused wax on your braces.\n3. Make sure the wire or bracket that is poking you is dry and clean. It can help to brush your teeth carefully to remove any food or debris from the wires, before applying wax. To dry your braces, hold your lips or cheeks away from the area with poking wires. Let it air dry for a few seconds or use sterile gauze and place it between the brackets and the inside surface of your lip to dry. You can now apply the wax.\n4. Apply the orthodontic wax ball to the poking wire. All you have to do is press it onto the offending area. Put the ball of wax on your fingertip. Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket. Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.\n5. Remove the wax before eating or brushing your teeth. You don't want the wax to get into your food while you eat. Discard any used wax immediately. Replace it with new wax after eating or brushing your teeth. Continue to use the wax until you can see your orthodontist or dentist to fix the wire. If you do happen to swallow the wax, that's okay. It won't harm you.\n\n\n## Fix a poke wire\n\n1. Try to bend thinner poking wires using the eraser end of a pencil. You won't be able to fix all poking wires this way, but this method will help in many cases. Find the wire in your mouth that is poking you. If it is a thin wire, get a pencil with a clean eraser. Gently touch the eraser to the poking wire. Push the wire gently to bend it. Try to tuck the poking wire behind the arch wire. Only do this for thinner, more flexible wires.\n2. Use tweezers to fix poking wires in the back of your mouth. Sometimes, eating hard foods can cause flexible wires in the back of your mouth to slip out of the bracket slots on the back teeth. If this occurs, you can try to fix these with tweezers. Get a small pair of thin nosed tweezers. Make sure they are clean before using them in your mouth. Grab the end of the poking or loose wire with the tweezers. Guide it back into the tube on the bracket slot. If you can't get the wire back into the slot, you will need to call your orthodontist.\n3. Fix broken laces that poke your lips using tweezers and pliers. You will need to see your orthodontist to follow up for a replacement. If the wire lacing of your braces is broken in the front of your mouth, you can try to tuck the broken lace behind the arch wire or around a bracket. Use tweezers to bend the wire away from your lips and cheeks. If the lace is on top of the arch wire you can can also remove it by cutting it with pliers. This is only recommended as a last option and should be followed by a visit to the orthodontist as soon as possible.\n\n\n## Treat cut and sores\n\n1. Use a rinse to clean your mouth. This can help to treat any sores or cuts caused by poking wires. Dissolve one teaspoon of salt in one cup of lukewarm water. Use this as a mouthwash by swishing around your mouth for 60 seconds. This may sting at first, but it will help to relieve prolonged discomfort and prevent infection. Repeat this four to six times a day.\n2. Avoid foods that are acidic, sugary, or hard to eat. Instead, eat a soft, bland diet. Eat foods such as mashed potatoes, yogurt, and soups. Avoid coffee, spicy foods, chocolate, citrus fruits or juices, nuts, seeds, and tomatoes. These foods are high in acid and can aggravate any sores or cuts from your wires.\n3. Drink cold water or iced tea. Cold (unsweetened) beverages can help ease the pain from sores. Use a straw to sip a cold drink, taking care not to scrape the cut or sore. You can also eat popsicles to apply cold to the sore. Alternatively, suck on an ice cube. Let the ice sit on the cut or sore for a few seconds at a time.\n4. Put an oral anesthetic gel onto any sores or cuts. These can help relieve any discomfort from poking wires temporarily. You can buy Orajel or Anbesol at most pharmacies. Put a small amount of the gel on the end of a q-tip. Rub the gel over any sores or cuts in your mouth. You can reapply the gel three or four times each day.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to find out if your friend's crush is crushing back?","response":"Navigating the depths of love is hard to say the least. This is especially true when you're trying to be a good friend and tasked with investigating the true feelings of a friend's crush. With some intuition and old-fashioned honesty, you can make the complicated game of love a little bit easier.\n\n## Make honesty work\n\n1. Be up front. The easiest and most effective way is to just ask your friend's crush about their feelings. If you're having trouble working up the courage to ask such a personal question, there's a few ways to make the process easier. Consider the time and place you're going to have the conversation. Make sure the crush is in a comfortable area, probably out of earshot from anyone who could listen in. Be gentle. Don't use confrontational lines, such as \"Everyone knows you like Ryan. Just come out and say it!\" Instead, you might say \"You seem really happy around Ryan. Do you think you might have feelings for him?\" Don't pry too much if they seem uncomfortable. If the crush seems to get embarrassed during your conversation, back off a bit. They may need time before they're willing to divulge such sensitive feelings.\n2. Ask about their love life. Instead of asking the crush directly about your friend, try starting with their love life in general. Ask to see if they're dating anyone or if they're currently looking to find a love interest.\n3. Ask about your friend in a platonic way. Ask your friend's crush less leading questions about your friend, and see if they naturally bring up their potential attraction. Try questions such as, \"So how did you and Cayla meet?\" or \"How long have you known each other?\"\n\n\n## Spot a flirt\n\n1. Examine body language. People give off noticeable changes in their movements when they feel attracted to someone. While everyone has their own set of bodily cues, there are some common signs to look out for when someone's crushing. Open postures such as uncrossed legs, open arms, and palms facing up. People will often lean in much closer to a crush when speaking with them in comparison to the personal space they use with platonic friends. Sometimes people will play with their hair, jewelry, or will simply make extended eye contact and smile during their conversations with crushes.\n2. Watch for eye contact. Prolonged eye contact, even for just over a second, is a common sign of either aggression or romantic interest. Pay close attention to how long your friend's crush gazes at your buddy. If they fail to maintain consistent eye contact, then it could be a bad sign for any hopes of a relationship. On the contrary, it's an excellent signal of affection if they constantly stay locked onto each other's eyes during conversations.\n3. Look at their social media communication. See if your friend's crush interacts with your friend frequently on social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Pay attention to the language they use with your friend, and see if they use obvious signs such as smiley face or winky face emojis.\n4. Look for compliments. People looking to give off signs of attraction will likely dole out many compliments to their crush. Watch to see if your friend's crush praises them on their talents or academic accomplishments. It's important to note that being complimentary isn't always a sign of affection, so it's crucial to pay attention to the frequency of their praise and admiration. Compliments on physical features are an especially key sign of flirting. Did your friend's crush notice their new glasses, haircut, or workout routine? Flirts tend to notice these subtle changes and point them out to convey affection. Sexual innuendos laced in jokes and conversations can also be not-so-subtle signs of a flirt's desire to spice up conversations with the person of their desire.\n5. Listen for references on their availability. Flirts will commonly drop hints in conversations that reflect their relationship status, such as mentioning they're recently single or how lonely they've been.\n6. Understand different kinds of flirts. Some people may flirt very openly and little guessing is required, while others can be introverted flirts with more subtle signs of affection. Physical flirts rely on body language cues to convey their feelings. They often use physical signs of affection before verbal cues, such as eye contact and playful touching. Traditional flirts tend to be more polite, preferring to convey affection over a longer period of time instead of using flashy and overt statements such as saying they're single or rubbing their crush's arm. These flirts also prefer professional environments like bookstores or study groups to build relationships over parties. Playful flirts use very clear signs of affection in a boisterous manner. For example, they may joke excessively in a sexual way with their crush or make bold physical complements about their crush's appearance.\n7. Talk to your crush's friends. Find out who your crush's friends are and ask around to see if what the status of the crush's feelings are. Chances are if the crush is significant the word has already made its way around to people.\n\n\n## Give your friend confidence\n\n1. Give them affirmations. Another solution is to give your friend enough confidence ask their crush directly so you don't have to do the leg work. Discreetly feed your friend affirmations such as, \"Everyone knows how confident you are, why not put it to use and ask Nicki how she feels?\" Congratulate them on little steps, such as starting small talk with their crush or asking them for help with some schoolwork. Give them support even when they falter. If they lose their nerve to talk to their crush at a party, let them know it's okay to be afraid sometimes and that there will be other opportunities to develop a relationship.\n2. Help them improve. If they feel uncomfortable with their body or lifestyle, start supporting healthy habits. Go to the gym with your friend, sign up for yoga classes, or start up a diet together.\n3. Listen to their concerns. Sometimes people can gain confidence just by airing out their insecurities. Ask them why they feel uncomfortable confronting their crush, and let them know it's normal to feel anxiety about such an important question.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to prepare a paper presentation?","response":"A paper is bad enough, but presentations are even more nerve-wracking. You've got the writing down, but how do you turn it into a dynamic, informative, enjoyable presentation? Why, here's how!\n\n## Guidelines and audience\n\n1. Know the requirements. Each presentation for each class is going to be a bit different. Some instructors will be happy with 3 minutes while others will demand you stand there awkwardly for 7. Have all the guidelines clear when you go to write your presentation. Know how long the speech must be. Know how many points you're required to cover. Know if you must include sources or visuals.\n2. Know your audience. If you're giving a presentation to your classmates, you probably have a rough idea of their knowledge on the topic. But for virtually every other circumstance, you may be in the dark. Either way, cater your paper to make zero assumptions. If you're presenting to people you know, it'll be easy to know what to break down and what to gloss over. But if you're presenting to unknown stockholders or faculty, for instance, you need to know about them and their knowledge levels, too. You may have to break your paper down into its most basic concepts. Find out what you can about their backgrounds.\n3. Know your resources. If you are giving a presentation in a facility you've never visited before, it's best to inquire about what you'll have at your disposal and what you'll need to set up beforehand. Does the facility have a computer and projector screen? Is there a working WiFi connection? Is there a microphone? A podium? Is there someone who can assist you in working the equipment before your presentation?\n\n\n## Script and visuals\n\n1. Create a script for your presentation. Although you could write everything out, it's best to use notes to jog your memory -- you'll sound more like you're talking and be able to make more eye contact. Only have one point per notecard -- that way you won't end up searching the notecard for your information. And don't forget to number the cards in case you get mixed up! And the points on your cards shouldn't match your paper; instead of regurgitating information, discuss why the key points of your paper are important or the different points of view on this topic within the field.\n2. Decide on a limited number of ideas you want your audience to comprehend and remember. To do this, find the most important points in your paper. These are the ones you should be drilling home. The rest of your presentation should be extras not necessarily addressed in your work -- if they've already read the paper, they don't need to be lectured on it. They're there to learn more. Make an outline of the highlights to help you prepare your presentation. As you form the outline, you'll see what aspects of your paper pop out the most and what order they would best be relayed in. As you go through this outline, remove any jargon if it may not be understood.\n3. Design visual aids to make your presentation even better. To help your audience follow along (and for the visual learners), use slides with graphics, charts, and bullet points to make everything a bit more captivating. It can enhance the information in your paper, yes, but it also keeps everyone from wiggling around in their seats. If you have any statistics at all, turn them into graphs. The contrasts will seem more stark when put in pictures before your audience -- numbers are sometimes meaningless. Instead of thinking about 25% and 75%, they'll be thinking about the 50% difference they see before them. If you won't have access to the proper technology, print visual aids on poster board or foam-core board. Presentation software (Powerpoint, etc.) can also double as notecards. Instead of messing with small pieces of paper, you can just click a button to get your next prompt. If using presentation software, use words sparingly, but enough to get your point across. Think in phrases (and pictures! ), not sentences. Acronyms and abbreviations are okay on the screen, but when you talk, address them fully. And remember to use large fonts -- not everyone's vision is fantastic.\n4. Think in terms of conversation. Just because this is paper-based does not mean your delivery should be equivalent to what an 8.5 x 11 can do. You have personality and are a human engaging with an audience. Use their humanness to do things you might not otherwise do in a paper. It's okay to be a bit repetitive. Emphasizing important ideas will enhance comprehension and recall. When you've gone full circle, cycle back to a previous point to lead your audience to the right conclusion. Minimize the unnecessary details (the procedure you had to go through, etc.) when highlighting the main ideas you want to relay. You don't want to overload your audience with fluff, forcing them to miss the important stuff. Show enthusiasm! A very boring topic can be made interesting if there is passion behind it.\n\n\n## Practice, practice, and more practice\n\n1. Practice your presentation in front of friends and family members. Don't be shy -- ask for constructive criticism. This helps you know whether or not you're meeting the time requirements and if not, how you could tweak your style. And once you've recited it 20 times before breakfast, your nervous should be at a minimum. If you can grab a friend who you think has a similar knowledge level to your audience, all the better. They'll help you see what points are foggier to minds with less expertise on the topic.\n2. Tape record yourself. Alright, so this one is a little much, but if you're really nervous, you may find listening to yourself beneficial. You can see which parts you're nervous about and which parts you have nailed down. It'll help you to see the flow, too, when you listen back. It'll also help you with volume. Some people get rather timid when in the spotlight. You may not be aware that you're not loud enough!\n3. Be warm. You are allowed to be a person, not just a machine that relays facts. Welcome in your audience and take a few seconds to establish a comfortable atmosphere. Do the same with your conclusion. Thank everyone for their time and open the floor for any questions, if allowed.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to deal with being picked on?","response":"Many people are picked on everyday. Physical appearance and social status are often reasons why people are picked on. No matter the reason, teasing can be uncomfortable, and no one deserves to be treated badly. When teasing becomes a pattern \u2014 as it often does \u2014 it can develop into a serious bullying problem, which can later cause physical and emotional harm. It is important to address such issues as soon as possible. \n\n## Face the situation\n\n1. Remain calm. Teasing may make you feel many uncomfortable emotions like anger or anxiety. Try not to react from a place of fear or frustration. Crying, fighting back, or insulting the other person is often the reaction that a bully wants from you. Remove yourself from the situation if at all possible. This will often de-escalate the situation immediately. If you do become angry, take a deep breath and count to 10. Try to relax your whole body as much as possible. If you find that you must say something, use a short word that doesn\u2019t escalate the situation. Try saying, \u201cWhatever,\u201d and move on. Refocus your attention on something positive. If you are feeling upset, look for something or someone that makes you feel safe and happy.\n2. Don't retaliate. As much as you might want fight back, it's important that you keep composure. Starting a physical fight can get you in serious trouble. Insulting a bully can often further provoke them and make the situation worse. Don't stoop to their level. Name-calling, harassing, picking on, or starting rumors about your bullies puts you in the same boat as them. Acting more mature than them gives you the upper hand, especially if you are in school where adults are always watching. Make it clear that you are the bigger person by saying something like, \u201cI\u2019m not even going to respond to that.\u201d\n\t* Remember that no one deserves to be treated poorly. Even if you refrain from retaliation, you should maturely confront situations that make you uncomfortable.\n3. Stand up for yourself. Express that you don\u2019t like what has been said or done. Speak in a firm and confident voice and then walk away. Showing that you have confidence \u2014 even if you don't \u2014 will let others know that you do not tolerate inappropriate behavior. Practice responding to the bully. Reach out to a trusted friend, a family member, a stuffed animal, or stand in front of the mirror. Act out the situation as realistically as possible. Practice saying short and neutral phrases that you feel comfortable using. Phrases like, \u201cStop that,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d or \u201cI've had it,\u201d are effective.\n4. Ignore the teasing. Ignoring a mean joke or teasing can be a successful strategy, especially if the situation is not serious; however, don\u2019t let being picked on become a pattern, as it can become quite harmful over time. Pretend that you don\u2019t hear the mean comments by keeping a straight face. This may be challenging at first, so it can take some practice. Bullies will often become bored when they can't get a reaction out of you. Look to a classmate or teacher and say something to show you are not paying attention to the bully. Try saying, \u201cHey, great shirt,\u201d or \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\t* Appear distracted by your cell phone. If you can, look at your phone and say, \u201cOh, I missed a call,\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t see that before.\u201d\n5. Recognize bullying. Sometimes it may be hard to recognize bullying until it has progressed or escalated. You may feel isolated, be afraid or anxious to go to school (you may start pretending to be sick so you don't have to go), feel helpless, have difficulty sleeping, notice a change in your eating patterns (eating more or less than normal), or your grades may go down. Familiarize yourself with the different types of bullying so you can address it as soon as possible. Physical bullying includes hitting, kicking, tripping, hair pulling pinching, pushing, stealing, or damaging your things. This type of bullying uses physical force to cause damage. Verbal bullying includes insults, name calling, teasing, intimidation, verbal abuse, or homophobic, racist, sexist, or ableist comments. This may start off as \"harmless\" teasing or poking fun at first and escalate. Social bullying or covert bullying is often difficult to spot. You may not realize this is going on, as it can occur behind your back. This includes spreading rumors, telling other people not to be friends with you, lying about you, damaging your reputation, playing mean jokes, mimicking, giving you the silent treatment, etc. Cyber bullying can happen at any time and can be public or private. It may be done directly to you or behind your back. Cyber bullying uses technology \u2014 such as social media, texting, email, websites, etc. \u2014 to target the person. It can include spreading rumors, impersonating you online, spreading mean or harmful videos or pictures, excluding you, sending abusive or hurtful messages, and intimidation.\n\n\n## Seek support\n\n1. Tell someone if the teasing becomes a pattern. You've probably heard people say, \"No one likes tattle-tales,\" but you must look out for your own well-being. If bullies become violent, start harassing you constantly, or harass you online, tell someone. Whether it's a teacher, parent, or guidance counselor, it is important that someone is informed. Even if you think getting others involved may make the situation worse, adults can often help you determine an effective action plan. If the teasing happens at school, talk to a trusted teacher or guidance counselor. School officials should have training in how to deal with bullying. Think about what may reduce the interaction with the bully and help you feel safer. This may include rearranging seating or providing more adult supervision. Talk to a parent or family member that can give you some advice. Your parents should be alerted of the situation, especially if you are in danger. Note that getting your parents to talk to a bully\u2019s parents, however, is often not recommended. A close friend may be the first person you are inclined to turn to when being picked on. Trusted friends should be willing to help you cope. They may accompany you to see a guidance counselor, or stay at your side when you are facing harassment. Telling someone that you are being picked on can be challenging. Let them know how you\u2019re feeling by starting with, \u201cThis is hard for me to talk about, but I wanted to tell you what is going on.\u201d\n2. Build self-confidence. Bullies pick on people who have low social standing or show low self-esteem. This does not mean that you should change who you are! Instead, work on feeling comfortable in your skin. Get involved in activities that make you feel good about yourself. Consider joining an school club, or take an extra class that helps you practice a skill that you enjoy. Exercise as a way to nurture a positive outlook and improve your self-image. You may enjoy a team sport, yoga, or self-defense classes. Positive affirmations are important in building security and self-esteem. Keep a journal and write positive things about yourself daily, not just when you are feeling bad.\n3. Learn from other people. There are several websites that are geared towards middle and high-school students who face bullying. Browse through the stories and advice on websites that provide a safe space for discussing such topics.\n\n\n## Help others\n\n1. Tell your story. Sharing your story can be helpful to others who are facing similar challenges. Write a blog or newsletter that explains your experience. Share what you are doing to confront the issue and make positive changes. Talk to your peers. If you know someone who is being picked on, find time to share coping strategies and practice ways to respond to teasing. For example, you can say, \u201cHey, I noticed that Jamie was annoying you. I hate it when he does that to me.\u201d\n2. Don\u2019t be a bystander. Do not encourage bullying behavior. Instead, help the person get out of the situation. Laughing at mean jokes or watching in silence suggests that you are not opposed to the behavior. Instead, let the bully know that you are not amused and\/or walk away. If you are a part of the conversation, try saying, \u201cHey, that\u2019s not cool.\u201d\n\t* If you see that someone is in physical or emotional danger, seek help from an authority figure immediately.\n3. Befriend people whom you think are being picked on. Reach out to others who are going through the same problem. Developing a friendship can help you avoid confronting bullies by yourself. Plan to sit together at lunch or walk home together. You may develop a great friendship, and you will be able to support each other when faced with bullies. Bring it up by saying, \u201cWant to get lunch today?\u201d or, \u201cLet\u2019s hang out on the way home.\u201d\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to core apples?","response":"Instead of buying pre-sliced apples, take advantage of whole ones while they are fresh. Whether you're baking apples or slicing one up for a snack, removing the inedible core isn't as hard as it looks. Use a paring knife or an apple corer to keep apples whole. For apples you need to cut first, scoop the core out with a melon baller. If you're looking for a quick way to prepare apples for cooking, peel them and slice off useable parts. Then, enjoy cleaned apples as is or use them as a component in another recipe.\n\n## Core whole apples with a knife\n\n1. Set the apple on a cutting board with the stem side up. Keep the cutting board on a flat, stable surface. Make sure it can't slide around while you're coring the apple. Since you're going to be using a knife, it's easy to slip and nick your fingers if you're not careful. Try putting something underneath the cutting board to help hold it in place. A damp towel or paper towel works well in a pinch when dealing with wobbly cutting boards. There are also non-stick cutting board mats you can get online and at kitchen supply stores.\n2. Poke the tip of a paring knife into the top of the apple. While holding the apple steady, push the knife into it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from its stem. You are aiming for the spot where the core ends. Cutting any closer to the stem could puncture the core and leave you with more of a mess to clean up later. If you don't have a paring knife handy, another thin blade will do. Choose the thinnest one you have in order to limit damage to the apple's flesh while you go after the core.\n3. Push the blade all the way through the apple. Hold the knife steady as you push it straight down so it doesn't cut into the core. Watch out for the sharp tip of the knife coming through the bottom's end! Tip the apple over on its side for a moment so you are able to see where the knife emerges. Coring is easiest with a knife that is longer than the apple. That way, you can remove the entire core in one go. If you don't have a knife like that, stick with a paring knife and scrape away any parts of the core left behind after the initial cut.\n4. Cut all the way around the core to separate it from the apple. Hold the apple steady and carefully cut in a circle without slicing into the core. Keep the blade \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the stem the entire time. This can be a little tricky to do at first, but it becomes much easier with practice. It leaves the core loose inside the apple, making it easy to remove by hand. If you're having trouble keeping the cut consistent all the way around the stem, try making more incisions. Place the knife on another side of the stem and push it all the way through the bottom again. Do this 4 times on all sides of the stem, then cut in a circle to connect the incisions.\n5. Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs. Raise the knife slowly so you don't lose control of it. Set it aside, then give the stem a good, hard push. The core will pop out through the bottom of the apple. If it is stuck, cut around the core again to separate it from the rest of the apple. Another option is to use the tip of the knife to pry the core up toward you. Once you are able to get a firm grip on it, pull it up to remove it. Knife control is important when doing this, so raise it with patience rather than yanking it toward you.\n6. Cut around the inside of the apple if you notice any seeds remaining. Sometimes these parts break off the core and get left behind. Put the knife back in the hole and scrape around the outside edge. Push the inedible bits out through the holes in the apple to throw them away. Once you're sure you got all of the black seeds and stringy bits of the core, you're ready to cook the apple.You could also use a melon baller to scoop out the insides. Twist the melon baller around to clear out the cut, leaving it clean and consistent.\n\n\n## Use an apple corer\n\n1. Place the apple on a flat surface with the stem face up. Set it up on something stable and damage-resistant like a cutting board. Coring tools are pretty sharp, so don't sacrifice your countertop for the sake of an apple core. Make sure you have plenty of room to hold the apple steady while coring it. Test the cutting board or surface by attempting to move or shake it. If it seems unsteady, expect it to move at the worst time. Try putting a wet towel or a non-slip mat underneath a cutting board to steady it.\n2. Place the apple corer on the center of the apple. If you have a tube-shaped corer, position it so the apple's stem is in the middle of the tube. Push the corer down until it begins cutting into the apple. If you have a combination corer and peeler, position it \u20444 in (0.64 cm) from the core with the serrated edge facing inward. Push the tip down into the apple to begin separating its flesh from the core. The easiest type of corer to use is one with a long handle and a circular tube with a serrated bottom edge. The tube fits over the core, holding it together while you pull it out. When using the vegetable peeler type of corer, you have to twist the blade around in a circle to cut out the core. The motion is the same as when using a tube-shaped corer, but it takes a little more work to rotate the corer by hand. You could also use a flat, ring-shaped corer. This type slices up the apple while removing the core. It's great for cutting an apple into wedges with one fell swoop.\n3. Twist the corer as you push it toward the bottom of the apple. This takes a little bit of force, so keep a firm grip on both the apple and the handle of the corer. Rotate the corer back and forth while pushing down on it. As long as you keep the apple still, the corer will go straight down toward the opposite end of the core. If you're using the blade-type corer, push it down into the apple and begin rotating it around the core. It will separate the core from the rest of the apple.\n4. Pull the corer out to remove the center membrane and seeds. What happens next depends on what kind of corer you have. With many tube-shaped corers, all you have to do is pull the handle back to take the core out with it. For blade-like corers, lift the blade out and then push the core out with your fingers. Check the inside of the apple for leftover seeds. Corers are better at cleaning out an apple than knives, but a loose seed or core fragment can fall out of the tool and get left behind.\n\n\n## Scoop the core out of a halve apple\n\n1. Set the apple on a stable cutting surface. Use a cutting board to prevent your countertop from getting damaged. Start by standing the apple up on the board with the stem face up. Make sure the cutting board can't move at all while you're working. Stabilize the cutting board by placing a towel or mat underneath it if needed.\n2. Cut the apple in half to expose the core. Use a sharp knife to split the apple. Hold it steady and cut vertically through it to the bottom. Try to slice through the center in a single, clean motion. You will end up going straight through the core, but that is okay. If you wish to quarter the apple, you could turn the halves over onto their cut sides. Slice them top to bottom down the middle. Whether you do this before or after removing the core doesn't make much of a difference.\n3. Scoop out the core using a spoon or melon baller. Keep the apple halves flat against the cutting board with the skin side down. This will give you a clear view of the seeds and the fibrous sheaths in the center of each slice. They are pretty easy to remove by digging into the apple's flesh right where it meets the hard, stringy core. Clean out both halves to leave the juicy part of the apple intact. If you quartered the apples, an alternative way to remove the core is by cutting underneath it. Use a paring knife to cut diagonally down to the center point underneath the core. Turn the apple slice around and cut from the other side to cleanly lift away the core.\n4. Slice away the stem and bud on each half with a paring knife. Keep the apple halves skin side down on the cutting board. The stem and bud are on the ends of each half, right above the removed center. Hold your knife parallel to these parts and cut diagonally down underneath them. Slice diagonally down from the opposite side to complete the cut and remove the inedible parts. There are pieces of the stem and bud on both halves, so remember to get them all. You will need to make a total of 4 cuts on each half, 2 apiece for each stem and bud. Another way to do this is by scooping out the stem and bud with a melon baller or spoon. It is less precise than cutting, so it takes away more of the juicy flesh.\n\n\n## Separate the core from a peel apple\n\n1. Peel the apple using a paring knife or vegetable peeler. If you have a good vegetable peeler handy, use it for an easy way to remove the apple's skin. Drag it from the top of the apple to the bottom to remove a layer of skin. After setting aside the peel, rotate the apple and use the peeler again and again to expose the juicy flesh.If you're using a knife, slip the tip of the blade underneath the skin. Peel from side to side across the apple, moving slowly to keep the blade as close to the skin as possible. Although using a knife gets easier with practice, you could slip and cut into the good part of the apple if you're not careful.\n2. Set the apple down on a flat surface with the stem side up. Stand the apple on a safe, stable cutting board. Make sure the board won't slide out of place while you attempt to cut the apple. As long as the board is secure, cutting the stem out is a quick and safe process.For your own safety and the sake of the apple, slip a damp towel or non-stick mat underneath a cutting board to prevent it from moving while you work.\n3. Slice across the apple to separate part of it from the stem. Pick up a sharp chef's knife and position it about \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem. Hold onto the apple with your other hand to stop it from moving. When you're ready, slice straight down, all the way to the bottom of the apple. This will separate part of the apple, leaving the core untouched and standing on your cutting board.Cut as close to the stem as you can to save the edible portions of the apple. If you cut too close to the stem, you might end up taking out some of the core. Cut the hard, stringy core chunks off the apple slices before using them.\n4. Turn the apple and cut away the other sides to remove the core. Rotate the apple so an uncut side faces you. Cut across it again and then all the way down to the bottom. Keep the knife \u20444 in (0.64 cm) away from the stem at all times so all the cut parts are even. When you're done, you will have 4 apple chunks that are clean and easy to slice up into whatever size you need.For example, lay the portions flat on the cutting board and cut them from top to bottom to create slices. Cut the slices from side to side to create smaller apple chunks.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"There is an

{"instruction":"How to say \"my name is\" in several languages?","response":"Here is how to say \"My name is...\" in several languages. The exact phrase is on top, with pronunciation guides in the bullets below.\n\n## European languages\n\n1. Say \"Moeto Nme e\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Bulgarian. This translates to \"my name is\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* \"MO-eg-toh e-meh eh \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n2. Say \"Ik heet \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Dutch. This is a somewhat gravelly sound. While \"heet\" is pronounced like \"hate,\" natural speakers almost slur the two together, almost like \"hee-EIGHT.\" \"Ick hate\"\n3. Say \"Je m'appelle \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in French. The words will somewhat glide together. This translates as \"I am called.\" \"Jhe- ma- pelle\"\n4. Say \"Me llamo \\_\\_\\_\\_ in Spanish. This one most people already know, but they still get tripped up by the double-L. In Spanish, the double-L sounds like an English \"y.\" \"Meh Yam-oh\"\n5. Say \"ich heisse \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in German. Really differentiate the three syllables, keeping them sharp and distinct. \"Ikh High- saa\"\n6. Say \"\u039c\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (Me lene) in Greek, or use an alternate expression. For more formal hellos, you can also say, \"\u039f\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"To o-no-ma mou e-ne,\") which translates to \"I am called.\" \"Meh Leh-neh\"\n\t* You can also change things up with \"\u039b\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9,\" (\"Leh-go-meh,\") meaning \"I'm named.\"\n7. Say \"A nevem\" in Hungarian. Like in French, the words need to somewhat slur together. The \"v\" sound in the middle should sound about halfway between a V and a W.\n\t* \"A neh-wem\"\n8. Say \"\u00c9g heiti \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \" in Icelandic. Icelandic is one of the world's hardest languages, but luckily fo you \"My Name is\" is quite easy. \"Yeg hey-tih\"\n9. Say \"mise \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Irish Gaelic. Not that this sounds completely different from how it looks. The \"se\" at the end sounds much more like \"sha.\" \"Mish-ah\"\n10. Say \"M\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0442\" Russian. No, that \"3\" shape is not a typo, it's just a part of the Russian Alphabet. If you don't have time to learn the whole thing, the pronunciation isn't tough. This translates into \"I am called.\" \"Men-ya za-voot\"\n11. Say either \"mi chiamo \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"sono \\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Italian. These are the English equivalents of \"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\" or \"I'm \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" \"Mi Chiamo\" (Mee Key-ah-mo). \u2192 \"My name is....\"\n\t* \"Sono: (soh-no). \u2192 \"I'm...\"\n12. Say \"Nomen mihi est \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Latin. If you know how to speak Italian, Spanish, or French, the pronunciation is very similar. \"Me-he no-men es\"\n13. Say \"M\u0103 numesc \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Romanian. You can also use the phrase \"m\u0103 chiam\u0103\" as well. \"Ma new-Mesk\"\n\t* \"Ma key-ama\"\n14. Say \"Eg heiter \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Norwegian. Like in German, you're looking for three well-pronounced, distinct syllables. The second word sounds like \"height,\" as in how tall something is, in English. \"Egg Height-er\"\n\t* Note: this may also be spelled \"Jeg heter.\" This second versions is the more formal, traditional spelling. Both are correct.\n15. Say \"Vol\u00e1m sa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to give your name in Slovak. For more formal, longer phrase, you can use \"Moje meno je \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\"). The words in Slovak tend to be slightly jammed together, especially here, where they might sound like one word. \"Vol-am say\"\n16. Say \"Jag heter \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Swedish. For more formal conversations, try out \"Mitt namn \u00e4r.\" This is tricky one, as the letters aren't used quite the same way in English. Try to make the \"i\" in \"mitt\" sound like an \"E\" sound. \"Yog Heat-err\"\n\t* \"Mit Nam Aer\"\n17. Say \"mia nomo estas\" (\"my name is\") or \"mi nomi\u011das\" (\"I'm called\") in Esperanto. Esperanto was invented in Poland after WWII as a politically neutral, global language. \"Mee-ah No-mo Ehs-tas\"\n\t* \"Mee no-me-jas\"\n\n\n## Asian languages\n\n1. Say, \"\u0986\u09ae\u09be\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae\" (Amar nam) in Bengali. If you can't read the characters, that is okay. The phonetic sounding is not difficult to pick up. \"Am-ar Nahm\"\n2. Say \"Mer\u0101 n\u0101m \\_\\_\\_\\_ hai\" in Hindi. Note how there is a word after your name -- \"hai.\" This translates literally to \"My name Nick is.\" This is grammatically correct in Hindi. \"May-rah nahm \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ hey\"\n\t* You use the same phrase in Urdu. It is written out as \"\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \\_\\_\\_\\_ \u06c1\u06d2.\"\n3. Say \"\u79c1\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f...\u3067\u3059\u3002(Watashi no namae wa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ desu)\" to speak in Japanese. Note that there is a word \"desu\" that comes after your name in Japanese. For simpler speaking, you can say, \"I am \\_\\_\\_\\_,\" or \"Watashi wa Nick\"' desu.\" \"Wat-a-shee no na-my wah \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n\t* Wat-a-shee wah \\_\\_\\_\\_ dehs\"\n4. Use versions of \"Ako si \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" to say your name in Tagalog (Filipino). There are several versions of an introduction in Tagalog, all of which are easy to pick up. The word for name, \"pangalan\"\n\t* \n\t* Casual: Ako si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \" \"AkOH see\"\n\t* \n\t* Polite: Ako po si \\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"AkOH poh see\"\n\t* \n\t* Formal: Ang pangalan ko ak\\_\\_\\_ \u2192 \"An pan-nall-en co ack\"\n5. Say \"\u6211\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u662f \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"W\u01d2 de m\u00edngz\u00ec sh\u00ec\") to say your name in Chinese. This is in the Mandarin dialect. Chinese is not just about accent but also inflection, which completely changes the meanings of words. This is one you should absolutely listen to examples of. \"Wuo - duh - meeng -- tza -- shuu \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* For a simpler translation, try \"Wuo Jiao \\_\\_\\_\"\n\t* In Cantonese Chinese, use the phrase \"Ngo kui tso.\"\n6. Say \"\u1781\u17d2\u1789\u17bb\u17c6\u1788\u17d2\u1798\u17c4\u17c7 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" (\"khnhom chhmoh\") to speak in Khmer. Things might get difficult in Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos, but this phrase can help start introductions. \"Ka-nohm ch'moo-ah\"\n7. Say \"T\u00ean t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_\\_\" in Vietnamese. Some speakers drop the first word, sticking instead with \" t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \\_\\_\\_.\" \"Ten Thoy la\"\n8. Say \"\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"p\u014fm ch\u00eau\") if you're a man, and \"\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d \\_\\_\\_\" (\"di-chen ch\u00eau\") if you're a female speaking Thai. Thai is a gendered language, so make sure you use the right form. The last word, though hyphenated below, should be smushed together. Male: \"pohm chee-ew\"\n\t* Female: \"dee-shaun chee-ew\"\n\n\n## African and middle eastern languages\n\n1. Say \"My naam is\" in Afrikaans. This language has some English roots, so it will be easier for you to pick up potentially. You'll also notice that is spelled with eerie familiarity...\n\t* \"May naahm ehs\"\n\t* Some people substitute \"Ek\" for \"my.\" This is more traditional, typically.\n2. Say \"\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0647\u0648 (Ismi houa)\" in Arabic. Some dialects of Arabic actually omit the second word, such as Sudanese Arabic. \"Is-mee Ho\n3. Say \"Ninaitwa \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ in Swahili. It's just one word, followed but your name. \"Nee-na-nweet-wa.\"\n4. Say \"\\_\\_\\_\\_ laa tudd\" to say your name in Wolof, a West African dialect. Note that Wolof is not a written language, so spelling is not very important. The language is common in Senegal, Gambia, and parts of North Africa. \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ la tood\"\n\t* You can also use \"Maa ngi tudd \\_\\_\\_\\_\" for \"my name is.\" Pronounced \"mahn-gee too-doo.\" Note the extra syllable on \"tudd.\"\n5.

{"instruction":"How to find accounting telecommuting jobs?","response":"## Account telecommuting tip\n\n1. Work in an office setting for a few years before starting to work from a home office. These years are not only valuable for experience, but they also allow you to build up a client base.\n2. Become part of a local professional network or volunteer organization. When you work from home, it is even more important to network with people in the business community. As a telecommuter, you will rely on contacts and referrals.\n3. Invest in organization and technology in your home office. Having fewer employees means that you will have to ensure your system is impeccably organized, automated and secure. Your ability to stay on top of projects is likely to have an effect on future jobs from repeat business. Other technology that you may want to look into is routing office calls to your cell phone, an Internet fax service, an online receipt scanner, like Shoe boxed, and video conferencing.\n4. Create a website for your business. You will need to invest in marketing in order to make your business appear legitimate to prospective clients, and get your name into the public. Keep the following information in mind when developing your website. Post reviews from current and former clients. This can help show potential clients the diverse types of accounting you can do. Advertise the advantages of using a home-based accountant. In general, home-based accountants charge approximately 70 percent less because they have less overhead. You may also be able to offer more flexible meeting times than office-based accountants and more personal attention. Link your website to your LinkedIn profile or a resume, so that clients can see what experience you have in the field and your certifications. Add on website plugins like an appointment scheduler and a contact form.\n\n\n## Find telecommuting job\n\n1. Ask your former or current clients for referrals. Although your clients may stay with an accounting firm if you leave it, the best way to look for jobs is to give out business cards and inquire with business professionals and former clients if they would give your name to anyone in need of accounting services.\n2. Reach out to your friends, family and contacts before tax season every year. Consider having a client appreciation party during the summer or holiday season, where clients are also encouraged to bring their friends. This will help you cement existing business relationships and perhaps find new ones.\n3. Register for online accounts with telecommuting job websites, such as Virtual Vocations or Freelanced. This site's job postings are dedicated to remote workers. You can post your resume for potential employers to see, and you can search by job date, location, travel requirements and employer when you need to look for work. You may also want to pay for a membership with FlexJobs, hea-employment.com. A membership will cost approximately $15 per month or $50 for a year. They also have a guarantee that you will find jobs.\n\t* \n\t* Comb the site ModernTelecommuter. Although this site is not fee based, it combs websites for telecommuting jobs, which can often be outdated. However, its aggregate function may save you time on your job hunt.\n4. Search on large job posting sites like CareerBuilder, Indeed or Monster. Make sure to tick the box that says \"Telecommute\" when searching on these sites. Also, keep in mind that there will be a large amount of competition for any posting, so you will need to apply quickly and often for jobs.\n5. Interview and list yourself with a local employment or staffing agency. Recruiters are always looking for professional contractors that may be able to fill positions with companies. Make sure to be clear about your desire to telecommute and your available time.\n6. Go directly to websites of large accounting firms and businesses. Review their job postings for telecommute positions. Although this takes a fair amount of research, it is becoming more common for businesses to hire remote, part-time workers to take on their accounts receivable and other bookkeeping tasks.\n7. Check back frequently on your local Craigslist site. A lot of part-time work is listed on this site. Businesses or individuals may be seeking an accountant, without having restrictions on where the work is done.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to handle a dramatic sister in law?","response":"## Tone down the drama queen\n\n1. Realize that you may be dealing with a drama queen. The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result. Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \"outrageous\" the price of child care\/electricity\/shampoo\/dog grooming\/car maintenance\/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully. Learn not so much to disagree as to fail to agree\u2013\u2013there is a fine line but it's about acknowledging her underlying need (notice me, care about me, help me, etc.) without buying into her view of the world.\n2. Do not get involved with the drama. Your S-I-L can let off steam, vent away and curse all she wants but there is no need to join the negativity. Avoid taking any of what is said personally\u2013\u2013the crazier the reactions and actions, the more your S-I-L is grasping at straws to try and provoke you and restore the limelight back onto her. Let her have the limelight in her own home but don't hang around to be vented upon. If it gets really bad, simply announce that you will come back when she is feeling calmer and leave. Equally, if it's happening in your own home, tell it's time to leave. (You can even make up a fake appointment or an early bedtime if you really need a polite excuse.)\n\n\n## Deal with your hot button\n\n1. Look to yourself first. It can be hard when to do this when someone else pushes your buttons. But it is important because it is your reaction that defines whether or not she feels she can keep going in the same direction with you. Some of the things to consider include:\n\t* Stay silent and there's a risk she just thinks you're dumb, awed by her or chewed up with resentment. Take your pick, she's probably happy to think you're feeling all three. And she'll use your silence to keep putting across her point of view at the expense of yours. If you're grinning and bearing it, you're likely turning into a doormat. Argue and she probably thinks her brother\/sister has married an angry, resentful and bitter so-and-so who hates her and will do anything to come between her and her brother\/sister. You may feel as if you're defending yourself but to her, it's about you not caring what she thinks and possibly even about putting her down. This doesn't mean there isn't room for disagreement; it just means that the manner in which you realign her understanding must be done with care.\n2. Create boundaries. State the facts about matters that she pressures you about, firmly but politely, and avoid being emotional into the bargain. If you state things simply, stick to the facts and avoid making it into an issue about her, she has few places to run. Be aware that she may continue to resent you for speaking your mind in an assertive and self-effective way but this shouldn't stop you from clarifying your position. Ultimately, she has to respect someone who doesn't argue, lose their temper or bite their tongue but instead makes it absolutely clear where the boundaries exist. And even if she doesn't everyone else will plainly see that you are the cooler head in the room. For example, let's say your daughter Sheila has been running outside and has fallen over. Your S-I-L insists that she needs to see a doctor or something terrible might happen. You are quite sure nothing of the sort will occur and you know you're a good parent but S-I-L keeps badgering you, upping the intensity of all the bad things that will happen if you fail to follow her advice. Offer your S-I-L a calmly spoken \"That's very kind of you to notice that Sheila has a bruised knee but I am thoroughly satisfied that Sheila is going to be all right; this happens all the time and is a part of the way she learns to cope with the great outdoors. She does not need to see the doctor.\" And that's the end of it, no need to enter into any further discussion. If S-I-L keeps trying, smile and change the subject; refuse to re-engage on the matter.\n\n\n## You and your spouse\n\n1. Talk to your spouse about your feelings. Avoid name-calling, insulting or insinuating anything about your sister-in-law. Instead, explain how you feel when the proverbial dung hits the fan whenever you're in her presence. Your spouse cannot fault your feelings, so be clear and thoughtful in stating them. This puts your spouse on notice that you've recognized the behavior of your S-I-L for what it is and that you have chosen to no longer accept being at the receiving end of it. For example, \"Georgia, when your sister talks a lot about how hard it is to fund her children's private schooling, I feel claustrophobic because she doesn't know when to stop discussing it. Given that we can barely afford our mortgage, I feel a little distressed at this kind of talk all night. I'd like to stop putting myself in this position from now on by simply acknowledging her problem but not letting her continue discussing it all night and I'd like you to help me do this by finding other subjects to talk about that don't involve money. Do you think that this is something you can get on board with? \".\n2. Ask your spouse to think carefully about the way in which he or she relays information about family issues. Tell your spouse that you love to hear about how your sister-in-law is doing but that you don't appreciate hearing about the embellished drama that often comes with it. Help your spouse to recognize what you consider to be \"drama\" from what you consider to be \"real news\" and in time, both of you will learn to speak about family matters in a less dramatic and more emotionally healthy way. Remind your spouse gently whenever you feel that your S-I-L's drama is being repeated in your house. You could even have a special signal rather than having to spell it out each time. Place a ban on gossip at home (or anywhere). Remind one another whenever it veers anywhere near close to gossip and shut it down. It doesn't matter if you feel you are being gossiped about; you're the bigger person for not engaging in the same behavior.\n\n\n## Cop with your s-i-l's call and message\n\n1. Avoid answering what isn't worthy of a response. Don't respond to any text messages that do not directly relate to a family get-together, positive messages or something else perfectly normal. If you are getting texts that spell out her outrage about things that have happened to her, her annoyance at something you've apparently done or to send you gossip about family or friends, let it slide and leave her wondering. If you feel angry and want to send back a retort, reprimand or justification straight away, don't do it. Treat your anger or irritation as a warning sign to sleep on the matter. Furious texting or messaging can only end in more angst on both sides.\n2. Keep social media networking to a minimum with your sister-in-law if she sets off your buttons. If your S-I-L is truly a pain and a bit of a drama queen, it's possible that her social networking reflects her attention-seeking ways. You can be all too easily drawn into a web of her anger and drama venting if you can see her Facebook updates or her latest tweets. If she friends you, you can do one of several things. One, simply ignore the request. When she asks you about it, tell her that you don't use social media much to exchange important things (or at all); or\n\t* Two, reply to her with a \"Thanks but no thanks, I am not accepting new requests at the moment due to busyness\/privacy\/overloading, etc.\" You might also add something like, \"Besides, we see each other often and I prefer we talk face-to-face\"; or\n\t* Three, turn all of your settings to private so that she can't see who you are friends with. Either say nothing or tell her either that you stopped using social media or that you only have a tight knit circle of followers and don't wish to extend it at the moment. If you say you didn't receive any request, she'll only resend it, but it might buy enough time to throw her off the whole idea if you offer to \"look into it\" but let the \"looking into it\" drag on and refuse to raise the matter again); or\n\t* Four, offer her a more neutral alternative. Offer to friend her on Pinterest and focus solely on a shared craft or cooking board. Nothing racy or mean spirited, of course. Try to avoid using the terminology of \"friends\" when discussing any refusal to accept her request. Unfortunately, the usage of this term by social media sites has caused many people to take it at face value; many people are simply followers or fans, not friends. She might feel devalued if you make any suggestion that she is being rejected as a \"friend\". If she is already a follower of one or more of your networking sites, you might consider blocking her and turning your pages private on some sites. Most probably you will need to explain what has happened (with a sound excuse); if she's a drama queen, she'll not only notice but she'll take offense too.\n3. Take care if you do soldier on and try to be her friend online and\/or through the phone. If she acts abusively, it is recommended that you keep records to show your spouse and other family members if needed. Save messages, emails, voice-mails, etc. Some drama queens like to \"attack\" when nobody else can see, thinking you won't have the courage to out them. This isn't about deliberately looking for dirt but it is a way of protecting yourself if anything should get out of hand. However, this is truly the stuff of last resort\u2013\u2013if you handle yourself deftly in public situations around your S-I-L, everyone will know for real who is behaving and who is stirring the pot.\n\n\n## A kinder future together\n\n1. Get on with your lives together. You married your spouse, not your family. While his or her family members are part of the package, they are not a part of your intimacy and they do not share the same journey with the two of you. If you make it very obvious that you're not bothered by jealousy, insinuations, rumors or gossip, it will soon become clear to your S-I-L that her barbs, attitude and meanness aren't pricking you in the way that they used to. Eventually, it ceases to be profitable or enjoyable for her to keep bothering and most likely she'll begrudgingly go and find someone else to taunt and hassle. Spend less time around your S-I-L. In what ways are you putting yourself in her pathway? While it may feel like you have to put up with her, you can find ways to reduce the time spent together. For example, ask other family members to meet you at different times than when she is around, more often than not. Don't always do this, or she will have a legitimate cause for complaining, but time spent with other family members shouldn't always involve her presence. If you live far away and have to visit once a year, stay in your own accommodation to give yourself respite. Take walks, get outside and don't overstay any welcome when it comes to drawn-out family events that press your buttons. Families know the pressure points better than anyone and unfortunately, some like to press them. At such events, your S-I-L probably has alliances that she can set in train to be even more effective, so the less time spent near such complaint-prone cliques, the better.\n2. Listen for real. When you are around your S-I-L, try active listening and acknowledgment in place of letting your fog of self-defensiveness take control. When she gets on top of her complaining mountain, instead of trying to topple her off with \"if you think that's bad, you should live in my shoes\" replies, actually focus on her and try to discern what is really driving her jibes, whining and gossip. By not making this about you, you may be truly surprised at what you unearth.As for responding to her, acknowledge her pain with neutral comments like: \"I'm sorry you have had to go through that to pay an electricity bill. It must be hard having four kids chewing through the power each month.\" Don't offer advice, don't offer how you would deal with it and don't ever offer to pay or pave the way to see her problem resolved. She owns it, you simply acknowledge it.\n3. Be compassionate. If your S-I-L has been a pain more than once and has even done things to show you up or drag you down, the chances are that she will try to do it again, even when you don't bite. But if you're ready for it and if you're understanding as to where she is coming from (insecurity, loneliness, feeling left out, needing to be in control, etc. ), you can be compassionate about her actions and detach yourself from her drama. If you don't carry her load, she'll be forced to do it for herself and will stop seeing you as a viable target.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to repair a punctured tire?","response":"Did you know that you can repair your punctured tire, and not have to spend all that cash buying a brand new tire? If you're prepared to get a little greasy and do the legwork yourself, you can find yourself back on the road and enjoying the drive-in on time.\n\n## Patch a puncture tire\n\n1. Locate the tire that is losing air. Remove your valve caps first. You can either find the hole by looking for the nail that is pierced through the tire, or you can put the tire in a tub of water and roll it around in driving rotation. There should be air bubbles where the hole is.\n2. Take the tire off from the rim. This allows the puncture to be easily accessed.\n3. Remove anything that's in the tire. If you have found the hole, and there is a nail punctured through it, use your pliers. Grab from the threading of the nail and lift out the nail. Mark the hole with tire chalk for easy access.\n4. Once the hole is clear, squirt some buffering solution over the puncture. This allows the buffer to work effectively and leave you with a smooth surface.\n5. Grab your buffer machine. Make sure that you have a sanding pad surface on your buffer to get a smooth surface. Buff all around the punctured area in a circular motion to make sure you get everywhere you need.\n6. Use a Tire Radial Patch. You can start by first removing the sticky pads of the inner side of the Radial Patch. Then from the inside of the tire, you can stick the Radial Patch through the hole about halfway with the aluminum side first.\n7. Spread the Tire Chemical Care (Seal Fast B-133). Using the brush at the end of the cap, spread the liquid material all around the Radial Patch string as shown in the picture.\n8. Pull the rest of the Radial Patch through the tire. You must pull all the way through until the patch completely sits on the inner side of the tire, and the aluminum piece comes out of the rubber.\n9. Cut the long leftover end of the patch using your cutting pliers. Scissors will work too. As shown in the picture, you want to cut as low as you can.\n10. Roll over the patch. Using your Tire Retread and Repair Tool, run over the Radial Patch from the inside of the tire. You can roll it in any direction, as long as you make sure to get every spot of the patch. Once the steps have been completed, your tire is ready to hit me back on the rims and filled to the pressure needed to be back on the road.\n\n\n## Temporary fix on a puncture tire\n\n1. Locate the tire that is losing air. Remove your valve caps first. You can either find the hole by looking for the nail that is pierced through the tire, or you can put the tire in a tub of water and roll it around in driving rotation. There should be air bubbles where the hole is.\n2. Keep the tire on the rim and expand the hole. Using the Pistol Grip Rasp Tool, you can insert it through the puncture moving it up and down. It will expand the hole if needed to fit the Tire Repair Refills in.\n3. Spray Heavy Duty Silicone Lubricant over the punctured area.\n4. Grab the Pistol Grip Inserting Needle and take a piece of the Tire Repair Refills. Put the Tire Repair Refills piece through the Needle as shown in the picture.\n5. When the refill piece is placed in between the needle, you can hold from the pistol grip and pierce the needle through the hole and pull the needle back out. The Tire Repair Refill piece should be left inside the hole.\n6. Cut off the refill piece that is sticking out of the tire using the cutting pliers or even scissors. (If you have a lighter, you can even set the extra piece of the refill on fire).\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You can repair your punctured tire.","max_prob":5.6316337585,"ccp":-0.8662087359},{"claim":"You do not have to spend all that cash buying a brand new tire if you repair your punctured tire.","max_prob":28.6669158936,"ccp":-0.8662087359},{"claim":"You can find the hole in the tire by looking for the nail that is pierced through it.","max_prob":32.2130393982,"ccp":-0.005086214},{"claim":"You can find the hole in the tire by putting the tire in a tub of water.","max_prob":11.37840271,"ccp":-0.0165074539},{"claim":"You can find the hole in the tire by rolling it around in driving rotation while it is in the water.","max_prob":47.592414856,"ccp":-0.0830634728},{"claim":"You need a sanding pad surface on your buffer.","max_prob":20.6364574432,"ccp":-0.0298681373},{"claim":"A sanding pad surface helps to get a smooth surface.","max_prob":22.3961467743,"ccp":-0.0655461775},{"claim":"You can start by removing the sticky pads.","max_prob":27.3070068359,"ccp":-0.0656004317},{"claim":"The sticky pads are on the inner side of the Radial Patch.","max_prob":36.5518760681,"ccp":-0.0004720934},{"claim":"You can stick the Radial Patch through the hole.","max_prob":14.8423070908,"ccp":-0.1567359875},{"claim":"The Radial Patch is inserted about halfway through the hole.","max_prob":21.3444747925,"ccp":-0.5951589788},{"claim":"The aluminum side of the Radial Patch is inserted first.","max_prob":16.2496261597,"ccp":-0.0180340688},{"claim":"The action is performed from the inside of the tire.","max_prob":11.7997655869,"ccp":-0.1178133152},{"claim":"There is a brush at the end of the cap.","max_prob":15.6278514862,"ccp":-0.0967780569},{"claim":"There is a liquid material.","max_prob":12.6621227264,"ccp":-0.0855437094},{"claim":"There is a Radial Patch string.","max_prob":13.6578941345,"ccp":-0.4434397377},{"claim":"The liquid material is spread all around the Radial Patch string.","max_prob":29.3272647858,"ccp":-0.5799204188},{"claim":"The spreading is done using the brush.","max_prob":4.9877891541,"ccp":-0.2754273041},{"claim":"There is a picture showing how to spread the liquid material.","max_prob":24.7614536285,"ccp":-0.4185849789},{"claim":"You must pull all the way through.","max_prob":10.2852973938,"ccp":-0.9793524926},{"claim":"The patch completely sits on the inner side of the tire.","max_prob":18.707244873,"ccp":-0.004414497},{"claim":"The aluminum piece comes out of the rubber.","max_prob":18.7343025208,"ccp":-0.3091248446},{"claim":"You have a Tire Retread and Repair Tool.","max_prob":24.0208129883,"ccp":-0.0136011315},{"claim":"There is a Radial Patch.","max_prob":2.7601430416,"ccp":-0.5016262238},{"claim":"The Radial Patch is located on the inside of the tire.","max_prob":4.3685145378,"ccp":-0.3030276217},{"claim":"You can run over the Radial Patch using the Tire Retread and Repair Tool.","max_prob":33.4608535767,"ccp":-0.0123191595},{"claim":"You can use the Pistol Grip Rasp Tool.","max_prob":26.7098407745,"ccp":-0.0000001369},{"claim":"You can insert the Pistol Grip Rasp Tool through the puncture.","max_prob":36.4789047241,"ccp":-0.0000000694},{"claim":"You can move the Pistol Grip Rasp Tool up and down.","max_prob":39.20520401,"ccp":-0.0000001057},{"claim":"Grab the Pistol Grip Inserting Needle.","max_prob":26.3915309906,"ccp":-0.0000006413},{"claim":"Take a piece of the Tire Repair Refills.","max_prob":14.3059930801,"ccp":-0.1345212445},{"claim":"The refill piece can be placed in between the needle.","max_prob":21.0397911072,"ccp":-0.0092788934},{"claim":"You can hold from the pistol grip.","max_prob":23.1328907013,"ccp":-0.0348008766},{"claim":"You can pierce the needle through the hole.","max_prob":12.5472488403,"ccp":-0.1612339225},{"claim":"You can pull the needle back out.","max_prob":9.4589262009,"ccp":-0.0140664515},{"claim":"There is a refill piece sticking out of the tire.","max_prob":7.0354604721,"ccp":-0.1027608554},{"claim":"You can use cutting pliers to cut off the refill piece.","max_prob":14.4817047119,"ccp":-0.0969715739},{"claim":"You can use scissors to cut off the refill piece.","max_prob":12.3991165161,"ccp":-0.0923156757}]}
{"instruction":"How to prepare for a vaginoplasty?","response":"A vaginoplasty is a surgical procedure that reconstructs or tightens the outer and inner muscles of your vagina, which can become weak and loose over time. It may improve your comfort levels and symptoms of incontinence. Some even claim it can boost sexual pleasure though this is not well studied and highly individual. A vaginoplasty can also create a vagina if you're undergoing gender-affirming surgery. You can prepare for a vaginoplasty by visiting your doctor, arranging your surgery, planning your recovery, and following pre-op requirements. For gender affirming surgery, you'll work with your doctor to prepare for surgery.\n\n## Visit your doctor\n\n1. Talk to your doctor about the procedure. Your doctor can fully explain the procedure, as well as what you can expect afterward. They'll also discuss the risks of the surgery. Tell your doctor why you want the surgery so that they can help you avoid disappointment. The doctor will ask about your health and well-being before approving you for the procedure. Bring a detailed medical history, including conditions you're being treated for. Tell the doctor if you're seeing a therapist. If you're undergoing treatment for a condition related to your decision to get a vaginoplasty, such as body image issues, it's best to tell the doctor. Provide the doctor with a list of any medications you're taking, including the dosage amounts. Ask about your needs post-surgery. This includes what you should expect at the hospital and during the days after the surgery.\n2. Get a blood test. Your doctor will want to do a few simple tests to make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. First, they'll do a simple blood test, which is virtually painless. This lets them check your hemoglobin and health profile to ensure that you are healthy. They may also do a pregnancy test, as you won't be able to get a vaginoplasty if you're pregnant.\n3. Undergo a urine test. The doctor will also do a urinalysis to make sure that you're healthy. This is a simple, painless test. You'll just need to urinate in a cup, and the medical staff will take care of the rest!\n4. Confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't want more kids. You should not get a vaginoplasty if you want to have more children or if you're pregnant. In this case, it's best for you to wait until you're finished having children. Your doctor will likely ask you to confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't plan to become pregnant. The doctor may also choose to do a pregnancy test before allowing you to get the surgery.\n\n\n## Arrange your surgery\n\n1. Contact your insurance provider to check your coverage. Many insurance companies won't cover a vaginoplasty, as it's usually considered an elective procedure. This means you may have to pay for it out of pocket. If you're not sure you can afford the procedure, ask your doctor if they offer a payment plan. You can also look into CareCredit, a line of credit opened specifically for elective medical procedures. CareCredit requires an application similar to that of most credit cards.\n2. Make a budget for how you'll pay for the procedure. Factor in the cost of the procedure, your pre-op and follow-up appointments, pharmacy costs, and the time you'll need to take off work. Determine where you'll get the money, such as from savings or by borrowing. Some of your appointments could be covered by insurance, so you may not need to pay these out of pocket. In the United States, a vaginoplasty typically costs between $4,500 and $8,500.\n3. Plan the surgery in between menstrual periods if applicable. You cannot get a vaginoplasty while you're on your period. The best time to have the surgery is right after your period, which allows you as much recovery time as possible before your next period starts.\n4. Take photos of your genitals before the surgery. Your doctor may also want a set of photos. This allows you and your doctor to see the difference before and after your surgery.\n5. Make your surgical appointment. It usually takes several months to a year from your initial consultation to get your surgery. You should find out your surgery date about 2-3 months before it will occur. Your doctor can provide you more information about your unique case.\n\n\n## Plan your recovery\n\n1. Schedule time off of work. You'll need at least a few days to recover, but how long you should take off depends on your job demands. It's a good idea to request at least a calendar week. If your job is very physically demanding, you may want to take off longer. Ask your doctor how long you should take off. If you'll lose part of your income, make a special budget to help you cover your living costs.\n2. Ask someone to come help you. You'll need help as soon as your surgery is over. Someone will need to drive you home and help you take care of your needs. This includes getting any additional medications, preparing meals, helping care for pets, and completing household chores. It's best to arrange this help ahead of time. If possible, recruit a few friends or loved ones to act as a support system following your surgery. You can also hire a professional home-care nurse to help you in the days following your procedure.\n3. Create a pain treatment plan to make your recovery easier. It's normal to experience some pain after surgery, but luckily it's possible to minimize it. Planning beforehand can make it easier to treat your pain so that your recovery goes as smoothly and as painlessly as possible. Discuss pain medicine with your doctor. Obtain an over-the-counter pain reliever, if recommended. Ask your doctor if a prescription pain reliever might be right for you. You could also purchase a heating pad or single-use heat packs to help manage your pain.\n4. Stock your fridge and freezer with healthy, easy to prepare meals. Cooking will be hard following surgery, so it's a good idea to have lots of easy options at home. You could make meals ahead of time or use commercial microwaveable dinners. Alternatively, you could have someone cook for you, if this is an option.\n5. Plan mood boosters for your downtime. After your surgery, you'll need to take a break from regular life for a few days. Gather a few activities to occupy your mind during this time, like a book, coloring book, or favorite TV show. It's a good idea to collect a few easy-to-access options so that it's easier to keep your mood up while you recover. Check out a few new releases from the library. Get an adult coloring book or download a coloring app. Add a new comedy to your watchlist on your favorite streaming site. Place your iPad and other devices, including chargers, near your recovery area for easy access.\n6. Purchase menstruation pads if you're still menstruating. You won't be able to use a tampon or menstrual cup for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Menstruation pads are an easy alternative while you're in recovery. Ask your doctor before you resume using tampons or a menstrual cup. Your muscles must be healed before these methods are an option for you.\n7. Talk to your partner about sex after the surgery. You'll need to avoid sex for 4-6 weeks while your vagina heals. Make sure your partner understands this wait, and discuss ways you two can be intimate without having sex. Visit your doctor for a check-up before you engage in sexual activity. The doctor needs to examine your vagina and clear you for sex.\n\n\n## Follow pre-op recommendations\n\n1. Stop taking aspirin and blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery. All surgeries increase your bleeding risk. Blood thinners can further increase this risk by making it harder for your blood to clot. Over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen pain relievers can thin your blood, so you shouldn't take them before your surgery. You may also need to stop taking vitamins and supplements. Tell your doctor what you're taking so that they can advise you. If you are taking a prescription blood thinner, talk to your doctor about when you should decrease your dosage. Don't stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.\n2. Avoid smoking in the weeks before your surgery. Smoking can slow your recovery time. This is because it narrows your veins and makes it harder for blood to flow. This means that your blood isn't able to effectively deliver oxygen throughout your body, which is necessary during recovery. Your doctor may decide to check your urine to make sure that you have quit. It's best to stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to having your surgery.\n3. Shave your genital area before surgery. This makes it easier for the doctor to complete the procedure. It can also reduce your chance of infection. If you don't shave the area beforehand, the medical team may do it prior to beginning your operation.\n4. Follow your pre-op procedures. The doctor will instruct you on what to do in the days leading up to the surgery. The day before surgery, you may be instructed to fast. It's best to eat a hearty breakfast that morning, as the rest of the day you may only be allowed clear liquids. Your pre-op plan may also include the following:\n\t* A bowel cleanse\n\t* Fasting, with clear liquids\n\t* Drinking more than 8 glasses of water\n\t* Rest\n\t* Nothing ingested by mouth after the midnight prior to surgery\n5. Do relaxation techniques to cope with stress or worry. It's normal to worry before undergoing surgery. It's a good idea to spend some time relaxing the night before the surgery. Perform deep breathing exercises. Meditate. Stretch or do yoga. Color in an adult coloring book or app. Go for a walk outdoors if the weather is nice. Soak in a warm bath.\n6. Plan for an overnight stay at the hospital. You may be able to leave the hospital a few hours after your surgery, but many doctors will hold you overnight. Pack an overnight bag with a change of clothes, a light robe, slippers, and any toiletries you think you may need.\n\n\n## Prepare for gender affirm surgery\n\n1. Discuss the risks and options. Gender-affirming surgery is not right for everyone. It can be expensive and is irreversible. Your doctor and a therapist can help you decide if the benefits of getting gender affirming surgery outweigh the risks in your case. A therapist will determine if you're mentally healthy enough to undergo the procedure. They'll also consider how long you've wanted to get the procedure. Before you're approved, you'll have to show that you've been living as a woman for at least a year, including taking appropriate hormones.\n2. Obtain two letters of support from qualified mental health professionals. Each letter must be written by a mental health professional who is experienced in working with transgender individuals. You can search online for a qualified therapist near you using a site like Psychology Today. The letters should confirm the following:\n\t* Your gender identification is persistent and well-documented\n\t* You're competent to choose the surgery and consent to treatment\n\t* You're of legal age\n\t* You're being treated for any mental health conditions\n\t* You've been undergoing hormone treatment\n3. Plan to take extra time off work. It usually takes about 2 months to fully recover from gender-affirming surgery. At the very least, you'll need to stay home for the week after surgery. If you must go back after that week, however, it's best to arrange a lighter workload. If it's possible, ask your boss if you can have a flexible schedule or work from home. If you work a field job, ask for desk duty for a few weeks. You could also try working part-time. Check with your doctor before going back to work.\n4. Ask your doctor when you should stop taking your hormones. You'll need to stop taking your hormones before you can undergo the surgery. Each surgeon will make their own recommendation. In general, you can expect to stop taking them about 3 weeks before your surgery.\n5. Talk to your partner about sex post-surgery. After gender affirming surgery, it will likely take 2 months to fully recover. You will need to avoid sex during this time. You can still be intimate in other ways, and it's a good idea to explore those options before your surgery.\n6. Remove the hair from your genital area. Check with your surgeon to find out what this will entail. For some, it may just mean shaving your genital area. However, some surgeons require you to get electrolysis hair removal prior to getting gender-affirming surgery.\n7. Expect to be in the hospital for about 5-7 days. Your doctor will likely admit you to the hospital a day or 2 before your surgery. You'll then need to remain in the hospital after your surgery for at least 3 nights. However, the entire length of your stay can vary. It's a good idea to ask your doctor what the average hospital stay is for their patients. In the days after your surgery, you'll likely experience some pain and discomfort in your vagina. The doctor can help manage your pain as you heal.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to host a what not to wear party?","response":"Many people love the TV show \"What Not to Wear\", so it would obviously make a great party idea for them! Here's a guide on how to make your What Not to Wear party one to remember!\n\n## Step\n\n1. You can do this party one of two ways: Make it just like the show, and invite one of your friends\/family members that makes fashion faux-pas a little too often, then surprise them by saying they they're going to get a fashion makeover! This is a great idea for a surprise birthday party, because then all the guests could get the birthday person fashionable clothes or gift cards to cool stores. Tell all your guests to wear their most horrible outfits. Floor-length skirts, see-through shirts, unmatched colours and patterns, old lady dresses, nurse's shoes, and bad makeup. Also, tell them to bring their favourite\/most fashionable outfits. This is a good theme for younger kids\/teenagers because it gets the guests more involved. If you want, you can mix components of both parties.\n2. For both parties, assign your own family\/friends to be the cast of \"What not to Wear\". If possible, get a man and a woman and assign them as the hosts (Clinton Kelly and Stacy London), then a woman to be the makeup artist (Carmine), and possibly even a man to be the hairstylist (Ted Gibson). However, it's not recommended to have your hairstylist actually cut anyone's hair. Instead, have them braid their hair, or curl, crimp, or straighten it.\n3. For both parties, decorate your house\/party space just like the \"What not to Wear\" studio. Make sure to have a place for your guests to get their makeup done by your very own Carmine. Place pictures of fashionable outfits around your house as well.\n4. At the end of either party theme, eat cake\/snacks, chat, dance, or do whatever you please now that everyone looks great, and you can go to bed knowing that you had a great party!\n\n\n## \"what not to wear\" replica theme\n\n1. When you send out invitations to your guests, tell them to send you pictures of your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (the FF-PP) wearing their worst outfits.\n2. Once the party starts, sit your 'Fashion Faux-Pas Person' (FF-PP) down, and tell them that you've been secretly filming them for the past 2 weeks (or however long you want). Then show them the pictures that your friends\/family sent in of them. Then tell them that they're going to get a huge makeover!\n3. Go through your FF-PP's outfits and 'throw them away' (You don't have to if you don't want to).\n4. Instead of going shopping for new outfits like they do on the show, open your guests' presents (if they've gotten the birthday person clothes and gift cards). That will be their new wardrobe.\n5. Give your FF-PP a makeover! Do their makeup, nails, and hair.\n6. Reveal your made-over FF-PP to your guests.\n\n\n## Worst-dressed to best-dressed theme\n\n1. Send out invitations with the 'What not to Wear' logo on them, as well as pictures of Clinton Kelly and Stacy London, the hosts of the show. You can also have pictures of horrible outfits and put big red 'X's over them.\n2. Once everyone has arrived at the party, award your 'Worst-dressed Person' with a prize (something fashion-related, such as a pair of cute earrings).\n3. Have a 'worst-dressed' photo shoot. This is a lot of fun.\n4. Have 'Stacy' and 'Clinton' critique everyone's outfits, just like on the show.\n5. Tell your guests to get dressed in their favourite\/most fashionable outfits. If somebody forgets theirs, lend them one of your chic outfits!\n6. After your guests are all dressed up, it's time for a makeover! Have some makeup on-hand, as well as some nail polish for manicures. Also, give them to option of curling, straightening, and\/or crimping their hair.\n7. After everyone's makeovers are finished, announce the \"Best-Dressed Award\". Give them a prize similar to the winner of the \"Worst-Dressed Award\".\n8. Once the \"Best-Dressed Award\" has been handed out, it's time for a photo shoot! Take pictures of your guests in their best outfits.\n9. Have your guests be revealed to 'Stacy' and 'Clinton'. Make sure that Stacy and Clinton both say positive stuff about the guest's outfits. Make sure that the person playing Stacy London says \"Shut up!\" frequently (she says \"Shut up!\" whenever she's impressed with an outfit).\n10. Reveal your pictures of your guests in their worst outfits (Before) and their best outfits (after). This will be a lot of fun and will get a lot of laughs.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Brainstorming,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to celebrate chuseok?","response":"\"\ucd94\uc11d\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or \ucc28\ub840. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"\ubc8c\ucd08\" and Seongmyo \"\uc131\ubb18\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"\uc1a1\ud3b8\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to set up an aquarium?","response":"Setting up an aquarium can be quite difficult that involves a lot of patience, maintenance, and testing before you can even add any tank inhabitants. Despite this, setting up your aquarium correctly is vital for your pets' health and longevity. There are different ways to set up different types of aquariums.\n\n## Choose an aquarium type\n\n1. Decide if you want a freshwater aquarium or saltwater aquarium. There are many differences between having a freshwater aquarium versus having a saltwater aquarium. These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:\n2. Think about the size of tank you\u2019d like. A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:\n3. Choose what type of saltwater aquarium you\u2019d like to set up. There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank. Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums. Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock. Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists.\n4. Determine what the correct lighting and heating for your fish is. The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank. Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts. Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you\u2019ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank. Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights.\n5. Choose the appropriate type of filter or filters for your tank. All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:\n\n\n## Set up a freshwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical freshwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, gravel, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and soak your aquarium gravel or sand in a bucket. Use a pasta strainer to separate the dirtied water from the gravel. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, filling the tank with gravel, arranging your decorations and airstones, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are using an undergravel filter, place the bottom plates into your tank and attach all necessary tubes, airline, gang valves, and air pumps before adding your gravel. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add water to your freshwater aquarium. It\u2019s vital you treat your water with conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can find water conditioners at your local pet store with instructions on how much to add depending on how big of a tank you have. Don\u2019t fill the tank with water until you are sure of your aquarium\u2019s layout. It can get quite messy if you stick your hand in a full tank to move things around. Place a plate over your gravel to avoid messing up your tank layout. Pour water directly onto the plate so the pressure of a stream of water won\u2019t make a hole in your gravel or move your decorations around. Remove the place once your tank is full.\n5. Turn on your aquarium\u2019s filter, lights, and heater. This will begin your tank\u2019s nitrogen cycle. Ensure your tank is safe electrically before turning or plugging everything in. A power cord in the wrong place can cause serious injury to you.\n6. Wait a few days before adding fish to your tank. The nitrogen cycle takes a few days for it to completely stabilize. You might notice your tank becoming cloudy which means the cycle is kicking in. You can add some hardy fish like feeder goldfish to your tank to speed up the nitrogen cycle. However, don\u2019t expect the fish to survive, as the harsh conditions of a new aquarium can be quite stressful and inhospitable. Use a nitrate testing kit to ensure your aquarium is at its best quality before adding your fish.\n\n\n## Set up a saltwater aquarium\n\n1. Gather all the equipment needed for your aquarium. Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical saltwater aquarium needs:\n2. Clean your tank, decorations, and filters. Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water. Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities. Wash and massage your filter\u2019s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you\u2019re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge. Wash all decorations in clean water. Your substrate will be cleaned after your aquarium is set up.\n3. Set up your aquarium. This means putting your tank on its stand, arranging your power heads, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium. If you are adding a live rock, do not add substrate or decorations to your tank. You must cure your live rock before you can do this. Don\u2019t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don\u2019t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.\n4. Add saltwater to your aquarium. The saltwater mix you purchased should have detailed instructions on how to prepare your saltwater. Generally, you will be mixing room temperature water with the salt mix in a bucket or several buckets. If you don\u2019t have enough buckets, you will need to prepare your water in parts or mix the salt right in the tank. Check your salt levels with your refractometer. Typically, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.021 and 1.024 depending on the temperature of your water. Measuring the specific gravity of your saltwater means measuring the density of your water since adding salt to water increases the density of water.\n5. Cure your live rock. If you have FOWLR tank, you will need to start the process of curing your live rock, which could take up to 2 months to complete. To begin the process:\n6. Prepare your substrate before adding it to your tank. Before adding any substrate to your tank, you will need to prepare a bucket of saltwater to help clean it. Add your substrate into the bucket and stir. This allows the dust and dirt from your substrate to rise for you to siphon out with your aquarium vacuum. Use a cup or ladle to add your clean substrate to the tank. You will need to drain more water out of your aquarium to accommodate the addition of your substrate and any decorations.\n7. Wait a few days before adding fish to your aquarium. Thoroughly check your aquarium\u2019s water salinity, pH, ammonia, nitrate, and hardness levels using your test kits before adding any fish. The ideal readings for a saltwater aquarium with a live rock are:\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to do a simple number mind trick?","response":"Amaze your friends and relatives with these number-based mind tricks. These three tricks are arranged from easiest to hardest (smallest numbers to biggest). Even young kids can do the simple number prediction trick.\n\n## Simple number prediction\n\n1. Set the trick up. Tell a friend that you are performing a math trick. You will ask her to do some calculations secretly, then read her mind for their answer.\n2. Write down your prediction. Pretend to think hard for a moment, then write down the number 3 on a piece of paper. Fold the paper in half, without letting anyone see the number.\n3. Ask your friend to write down a number between 1 and 20. She should pick this secretly and keep the piece of paper. We'll go through an example, where your friend secretly picks the number 4. This trick works with any number, but keeping it between 1 and 20 makes it less likely that your friend will make a mistake.\n4. Instruct her to add 1 to her number. Warn her not to give you any sign, not even moving her lips. All you need is your mental powers. For example, if she chose 4, her new number is 4 + 1 = 5.\n5. Tell your friend to double the new number. Have her take the last number she had, and multiply it by 2. 5 x 2 = 10.\n6. Have her add 4 more. Put your hands to your head and concentrate, then tell her to add 4 to her last answer. 10 + 4 = 14.\n7. Divide by 2. Tell her you almost have it, but the number is too big for you to see. Ask her to divide it by 2 to make it easier. 14 \u00f7 2 = 7.\n8. Subtract the original number. Ask your friend to look at the piece of paper she used to remind herself what the original number was. Take the last answer she had and subtract that original number. 7 - 4 = 3.\n9. Show her your prediction. Tell her you've finally read her mind. Ask her to announce the last number she ended up with. Once she has, unfold your piece of paper and reveal the 3 you wrote down. No matter which number she started with, her answer will be 3.\n\n\n## Guess someone's age\n\n1. Tell someone you're going to find his age. Let him know you'll be using your mathematical mind-reading abilities. Give him a calculator if he doesn't want to do the calculations in his head. This trick won't be too impressive with close friends or classmates, since you probably already know their age. Pick someone at least 10 years old and no more than 99 years old.\n2. Ask him to multiply the first digit in his age by five. Remind him to do the math silently, to keep his age secret from you. For example, if he is 32 years old, he should take the 3 and multiply it by 5. The answer is 3 x 5 = 15.\n3. Add 4 to his answer. Tell him to add 4 to the answer he found. In our example, he would silently add 15 + 4 = 19.\n4. Tell him to double his answer. Now your subject should multiply his last answer by 2, and let you know when he's finished. If he's doing the math in his head, ask him \"Are you sure?\" since people are most likely to make a mistake on this step. 19 x 2 = 38.\n5. Have him add the second digit of his age. Next, the person you're \"mind reading\" adds the last number in his age. Tell him this is the last calculation he needs to do. Since the subject of our example is 32 years old, he would add 2 to his last answer. His last answer was 38, so he calculates 38 + 2 = 40.\n6. Ask for his last answer. Have him say the final number out loud, so you and everyone in the room can hear it.\n7. Subtract 8 and tell him his real age. Silently subtract 8 from the number he gave you. The answer is his age, which you should announce to the room. In our example, 40 - 8 = 32.\n8. Try some variations. If you perform this trick more than once, people might figure out how it works. Here are a couple variations to keep it mysterious:\n\t* Instead of adding 4 and later (secretly) subtracting 8, you can add 3 and subtract 6, or add 2 and subtract 4, or even add 25 and subtract 50. Just remember you'll need to subtract twice as much as the original number, because it got doubled in one of the later steps. To really switch it up, try this: double your age, add 2, multiply by 5, and subtract 10. You need both the doubling and multiplication by five to move the first digit of his age (3 in our example) to the tens place where it belongs (3 x 2 x 5 = 30).\n\n\n## Magical 37\n\n1. Hand a volunteer a pencil and paper. This one involves some three digit numbers, so most people will not want to do the math in their head. Warn the volunteer that he will need to do long division.\n2. Ask him to write the same digit 3 times. Tell him to hide the paper from you to prove you're not cheating. Ask him to write a 3-digit number that repeats the same digit three times. For example, he could write 222.\n3. Instruct him to add each digit together.

{"instruction":"How to manage urinary incontinence in children?","response":"Urinary incontinence (UI) is a medical term that refers to the loss of bladder control, which leads to accidental urine loss. This can happen during the day or at night. Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects many children when they are young and disappears as they grow and develop. To provide better support for your child with UI, it is important to understand how UI works and possible management solutions.\n\n## Understand the bladder\n\n1. Know how the bladder works. The bladder is a bodily organ that is essentially a muscular storage sack for urine. Normally, the bladder muscle sack can stay relaxed and expand to accept urine for several hours. The muscle that forms the bladder sack is called the detrusor muscle, which is also responsible for bladder emptying. The other main muscles of the bladder are called the sphincters, which are two rings of muscle surrounding the bladder outlet through which it empties. One sphincter is involuntary (you aren't aware of it) and the other is usually under our control, making it our voluntary sphincter. The latter is the muscle you can use to hold the urine back until you go to the bathroom.\n2. Learn about bladder control. There are nerves in your body that provides you with the sensation of bladder fullness. This is the early warning system that the bladder is ready to empty. When you urinate, the nerves to the detrusor muscle signal it to contract or squeeze, while at the same time, the nerves to the involuntary sphincter make it relax. When you release your voluntary sphincter, you allow yourself to urinate. By around age two, most children become aware that the sensation that they feel \u201cdown there\u201d is the need for the bladder to empty. This allows them to express the need to go to the bathroom. About a year later, they develop the ability to \u201chold it\u201d until they have a chance to go to the bathroom.\n3. Be aware of the causes of incontinence. There are issues that can cause problems when a child is learning how to \u201chold it\u201d. While most kids develop the ability to hold their urine and go to the bathroom when they have the opportunity to do so, problems can arise that can mess up a child's ability to control her bladder. These issues that are related to childhood incontinence can include:\n\t* A bladder that is unable to store the usual amount of urine. Weakness of the detrusor muscles or sphincter. Structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. The body producing larger amounts of urine than is normal. Bladder irritation from infections, such as urinary tract infections, or other bladder irritants. The bladder receiving unexpected and premature nerve signals to empty. Something in the area of the bladder keeping it from filling completely, such as other excrement caused by constipation. Excessive postponement of urination, or holding it for too long. Chronic constipation.\n4. Disregard the myths about incontinence. If your child has been dealing with incontinence for an extended period of time, chances are she is dealing with more of an issue that simply being too lazy to get to the bathroom. A lot of parents tend to think that daytime incontinence is a display of laziness, but it is important to keep in mind that something else might be causing your child to have accidents. Common thoughts that parents have that should probably be ruled out if your child has been dealing with incontinence for awhile. In these situations, you should know that:\n\t* Children who wet themselves are not just too lazy to go to the bathroom. Children who wet themselves are not too busy playing or watching TV. Children who wet themselves want to go to the bathroom and do not willfully wet themselves. Children who wet themselves do not choose to wait until the last minute. Wetting themselves does bother them.\n\n\n## Treat incontinence\n\n1. Look for signs of an overactive bladder. There are some common signs that your child has an overactive bladder. Signs that your child might have an incontinence problem related to under filling include:\n\t* Your child dashes to the bathroom, crosses her legs, and wiggles or drops to the floor, sitting hard on her heel. If asked, your child will often admit that she releases a little urine on the way to the bathroom. Many children also will admit that, sometimes, they run to the bathroom but only void a small amount of urine, even though they felt like they really needed to go.\n2. Look out for a cause for the \"sudden-urge-to-urinate\" phase. Some kids, while they are growing up, go through a phase where they suddenly, without warning, need to go to the bathroom really badly. This underdeveloped control, which presents itself as urge incontinence, often resolves with time as the child matures. However, this can also be the symptoms of a functionally small bladder or an overactive bladder. There are some medications that can actually increase a bladder's holding capacity. You should talk to a doctor about the options for dealing with a small or overactive bladder.\n3. Be aware of overfilling. There is a filling condition, called overfilling, that can also lead to incontinence. Overfilling is a less common condition that occurs when the bladder won't or can't empty and has an usually large capacity. Symptoms of an abnormally large capacity bladder include:\n\t* Voiding large volumes of urine frequently during the day. This can happen if the kidneys produce enormous volumes of urine. You should take your child to a doctor if you notice your child voiding a large amount of urine every time she goes to the bathroom, especially if there is a change in the amount from usual. Infrequent voiding, which is considered less than two or three times a day. This can be a sign of a spinal nerve problem, such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy. If your child has not been diagnosed with a spinal nerve problem, it is unlikely that this is the cause of your child's incontinence.\n4. Notice if your child is holding it for too long. Sometimes, if your child gets in the habit of holding his urine too long, it can result in over filling of the bladder. Your child's bladder can become enlarged if he is a chronic urine holder, which means he avoids going to the bathroom, even when he really, really has to pee. When this goes on for a long time, the muscles related to urinating become over trained, which means the muscles relax poorly, leading to bladder dysfunction like incontinence. This happens frequently when a child does not want to use the bathroom at school or other public places.\n5. Consider behavior modification therapy. Behavioral modification may be able to help your child with her urge incontinence. Most experts today favor behavior modification therapy over drugs as a first line treatment for daytime wetting of almost all types. Behavior modification is a method of training to relearn a skill such as bladder control. The therapy must be done strictly and consistently in order to get the desired results, such as your child being able to control her bladder. Behavior modification therapy generally works best in children who are older than five or six years of age. This is because younger children generally lack the self-discipline to stick to the therapy schedule. However, each child should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Child psychologists can provide good advice on how to go about creating a schedule.\n6. Create a schedule. If your child suffers from an overactive bladder, you need to create a schedule to help him. After your child goes to the bathroom in the morning, begin a strict timed voiding schedule. Normally, parents pick every two hours as the scheduled voiding time. Your child must go to the bathroom every two hours, even if he says he doesn't have to go at that specific time. That is actually the point, to get him to the bathroom before he has a bladder spasm. If you wait for the bladder spasm, you are reinforcing the absence of control. If your child does go and attempts to void, even a little, it reinforces his control about when and where he goes. If your child has an overfilled bladder, you should create the same schedule with an added step. Your child should wait four to five minutes after going to the bathroom and then try to go again. This is called double voiding in an attempt to reduce that lingering bladder volume. The goal is to change voiding habits and allow the bladder to carry a more normal volume of urine.\n7. Use an alarm system. In addition to a schedule, set an alarm to help your child remember to go to the bathroom. It can be hard to remember to go to the bathroom every two hours. Because of this, its important to set up an alarm system. When your child is at home or visiting family, such as staying at Grandma's house, set alarm clocks that go off every two hours. You can set these alarms on a smartphone or alarm clock. You can also get your child a watch that beeps or vibrates silently every two hours as a reminder for when she is at school. You may also consider trying a bed-wetting alarm if your child has nighttime incontinence (bed-wetting).\n8. Extend the voiding time. Once you have followed this schedule for four to six weeks, you should extend the voiding time. Normally, you should see improvement within four to six weeks. However, this does not mean you should stop the schedule. You should extend the time so that your child tries to urinate every three or four hours, rather than every two.\n\n\n## Treat urinary tract infections\n\n1. Notice urinary tract infections. You need to pay attention to your child to look for certain causes of incontinence. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are most common in girls who have just started school or have recently been potty trained. In addition to incontinence, UTIs can also cause frequent urination, a burning sensation when she urinates, cloudy or dark colored urine, strong smelling urine, and pain in the lower abdomen. UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. Some children who get frequent UTIs also have a condition called asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). These children, most frequently girls, have bacteria colonizing the bladder, meaning that they reside there, similar to having bacteria quietly living on our skin. This increase in bacteria in the urine can sometimes be the cause of frequent UTIs.\n2. Keep irritation at a minimum. Many kids, particularly girls, will develop irritation and inflammation in the area of the urethral and vaginal openings when they have a UTI. You can use certain creams to help relieve the irritation your child feels. In particular, a zinc oxide-containing skin barrier cream or ointment such as Desitin or Triple Paste can be very helpful. You can purchase these creams at your local pharmacy. Follow the directions on the bottle or box that the cream comes in.\n3. Change your child's clothing when it becomes wet. The bacteria that creates a UTI thrives in moist areas. When your child experiences incontinence and leaks a bit of urine onto her clothes, it's important that she changes into dry clothes to keep her from getting a UTI or to relieve the symptoms of her UTI. This will also keep it from coming back. You can explain this to her so that she does it herself, or you can ask her to tell you when this happens so that you can help her change.\n4. Ask your doctor about antibiotics. If your child has recurrent UTIs, you should talk to the doctor about getting antibiotics to clear up the infection and prevent new infections. Your child's doctor will be able to tell you whether or not antibiotics are the appropriate treatment for your child to prevent infections. Your child will need antibiotics if he has an active UTI. The most common antibiotics used for prophylaxis, or prevention of infections, are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim sulfa. These are usually given once a day, at bedtime, at about \u00bc of the usual full treatment dose given to adults.\n\n\n## Treat constipation\n\n1. Be aware of constipation. Another common cause of incontinence is constipation. When large amounts of stool stays in the body rather than being expelled, it can limit how much room the bladder has to expand and causes the bladder to have unpredictable contractions, both of which cause incontinence. Constipation usually causes infrequent bowel movements for 3 days or more in a row, hard, pebbly stools, very large stools, or pain when moving the bowels.\n2. Have your doctor check your child. If you aren't sure how bad your child's constipation is, have a doctor figure out whether or not your child has a lot of stool backed up in her system. This can be done with the use of X-rays or through a physical examination. Knowing for sure that your child is constipated will help her overcome her incontinence issues.\n3. Ask your child to drink lots of fluids throughout the day. Many kids with urgency and incontinence tend not to drink much fluid, which actually makes their constipation worse. Try to have your child drink at least eight glasses of water each day to stay hydrated. If your child doesn't like drinking plain water, you can give him fruit juices, milk (no more than 2-3 cups a day), and sports drinks.\n4. Increase your child's fiber intake. To help fight constipation, increase your child's daily fiber intake. Fiber is one of the best ways to get your child's bowels working properly. There are plenty of foods that are high in fiber. Try introducing as many foods that are high in fiber as possible into your child's diet. Foods high is fiber include:\n\t* Fresh fruit and vegetables, including raspberries, blueberries, green peas, spinach, collard greens, acorn squash, kale, and broccoli. Whole grain breads with at least three to four grams of fiber per serving. High fiber cereals, such as Raisin Bran, Fiber One, Shredded Wheat, and All Bran. Beans, including black, lima, garbanzo, and pinto beans. Lentils and popcorn are also high in fiber.\n5. Give your child laxatives. Adding fiber-rich food to your child's diet may not be enough. If your child is still having problems, try child-safe laxatives. One laxative that is safe and frequently used is propylene glycol, more commonly known as MiraLax. MiraLax causes water to be transported into the bowel, thereby softening the stool and improving movement. You should check with your child's doctor for guidance before giving MiraLax or other laxatives to your child. Most kids require between \u00bd capfuls and two capfuls per day, and the dose may be adjusted as needed.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to select an open source content management system?","response":"## Choose an open source cms\n\n1. Research your options. A quick Internet search will tell you that WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Plone and Blogger are probably the most common; however, there are dozens more. Make sure you are testing a CMS, rather than a vendor, as the names may be easily confused in the beginning. Many online reviews say that WordPress CMS is good for blogs, and Drupal is great for community-oriented sites, with a lot of user interaction. Joomla! works well for the most basic websites and users. Plone is a newer CMS that manages documents and community very well. You should make your own decisions based on what looks best for your site.\n2. Decide what experience you want to give your website visitors. Sit down with your marketing or branding department and make a list of the essential parts of a website, so that you can look for them in your CMS. This will help you to choose the frontend designs you prefer. You can also get a private web development company to design your template and plug in an open source CMS. This is considerably more expensive than simply choosing a ready-made design through an Internet-based service. It may allow you extensive customization of your site.\n3. Decide what you need from the backend of the CMS. For example, decide if you need search engine optimization (SEO) features, mailing lists, events applications, customization, scalability or a specific programming language.\n4. Test drive each programming platform. Assign 2 to 3 people who will be working with the programs most to do a trial run, or \"sandbox\" version, of the CMS. They should report back with reviews and rate them according to overall preference. Open source CMS can all be installed for free. You may need to hire a web programmer to install them, if no one in your organization is very computer savvy. You still want to test the backend of the system with the non-technical users. You can also go to opensourcecms.com to try over 70 open source CMS programs for free. The site will allow you to do a demo without having to install the whole program.\n5. Check if your web hosting service automatically installs any of the open source CMS. If you use shared server hosting, then the tech support you pay for may include installation of 1 of these programs. If so, and you like the program, you can save money that would otherwise go toward hiring a programmer.\n6. Read community reviews of the open source CMS or extensions you want to install. Each open source program has a web-based community that helps users ask and answer questions. You can get an idea of how easy it will be to accomplish the things on your marketing list by searching for reviews and instructions.\n7. Choose a CMS according to website functionality and employee functionality. Compare each CMS\/template with the frontend\/backend list you made. Choose the program that fulfills the most preferences on your lists.\n\n\n## Implement an open source cms\n\n1. Decide how you want to do installation and support. Since open source CMS are available to all, they have community forums that help with support. However, if you aren't very proficient with computer programming, you will have to follow an alternate method. Hire a web vendor to install the program and train your staff. Although you will need to pay for this service, it will decrease the problems you will have with the open source CMS. Ask if the vendor offers tech support help in the future at a fee. Task your IT department with installing and training staff. You may have to send part of your staff to a course to learn all about the program and its requirements. If you already have a fully competent IT staff, you will save money with this option. Install the program yourself and train your staff. If you and your employees are very computer literate, it may not be essential to get outside support. You can look for plugins in the directory and read how to fix problems in the forums.\n2. Be prepared for an adoption period. After changing any database, you should be prepared for a slow period where your employees learn to use the program, and at times, there are complaints. Try to wait for a period of 30 to 90 days before deciding if the CMS will work, because most website changes take time to adjust to.\n3. Look to enhance your open source CMS. Look for extensions and plugins, once your employees are completely functional with the backend. The great thing about CMS is that talented volunteer programmers are improving it all the time. Subscribe to blogs, newsletters or forums about your CMS blog. This will keep you aware of new updates or plugins. It will also direct you to websites that use the CMS so that you can see what others are doing with it.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to backpack in the rain?","response":"## Deal with a sudden storm\n\n1. Put on any protective gear that you\u2019ve brought. All hikers should carry lightweight rain gear or at least a poncho in case of rain. If you don\u2019t have these items, try to use what you do have, such as an extra garbage back that you carried just in case or a tarp.\n2. Keep your body moving. Even if you\u2019re trying to stay out of the rain, move around as you wait so that your body stays warmer. For example, march in place or step side to side. Hypothermia can easily set in if you get too cold, so generate as much body heat as you can.\n3. Seek shelter. Look around you for a place to duck out of the rain, such as a tree canopy, a cave, a cabin, or even your tent. If you plan on camping and have a waterproof tent, you may find that settling in early and riding out the storm is the best solution. If you hear thunder, seek immediate shelter. Staying outside during a thunder storm is dangerous.\n4. Watch for changes in the terrain. Rain can cause flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and slippery trails, all of which can be very dangerous. Look for signs such as flowing water, rising tide lines, shifting soil, and a sheen on the surface of the trail. When in doubt, walk away from the questionable terrain.\n5. Stay away from open fields, elevated areas, and water. If you\u2019re caught in a lightning storm, the most dangerous places to be include open areas, hills, mountains, trees, cliffs, and waterways. Lightning is most likely to strike these areas, so avoid them. If you\u2019re in the woods, try to find a small grove of trees that are surrounded by other taller trees. Tuck yourself in the lowest spot you can find. If you are stuck in an open area, look for the lowest spot, crouch down, and keep most of your body from touching the ground. Ideally, just the soles of your feet will make contact with the ground. If you have access to a vehicle, stay inside of it but try not to touch the sides of the car.\n6. Put down your trekking poles or other long objects. In a lightning storm, trekking poles and long, pointy objects make a great conductor for the lightning and are therefore very dangerous. Protect yourself by laying these items on the ground away from you.\n7. Pay attention to changing weather. Check the forecast before and during your trek, and watch for signs of a coming storm. If winds pick up and the sky becomes overcast, consider changing your route so that you can reach safety before the storm hits. It\u2019s better to cut your trek short and have the storm pass over rather than get caught in dangerous weather.\n\n\n## Plan a trek in a rainy environment\n\n1. Choose the right insulation for rainy weather. If you wear natural insulators like down or clothing made from cotton, the water seeps into the fabric and takes away the warmth. These fabrics can pull the heat from your body. Wool, fleece, and synthetics stay warm even in a downpour, so they are a better option if you know the weather will be rainy.\n2. Dress in layers. Stay warm by wearing long sleeved wool, polyester, or microfiber clothing under your rain gear. If the weather will also be cooler, add multiple layers. Your clothes will likely still get wet under your rain gear, but fabrics like wool and fleece can remain warm. On the other hand, you may want to look for items that dry easily, such as polyester. Choose items that will feel comfortable and flexible under your heavy raincoat. Avoid cotton, which will hold the water and drain your heat.\n3. Wear a hard shell raincoat and rain pants. A hard shell raincoat will hold up better than a soft shell raincoat in a sustained storm. You can protect your legs with rain pants or vented pants, depending on the temperature of the area and your preference as a hiker. Vented pants will be less insulating but dry quickly. Rain pants can help keep in your warmth and repel water, but they will eventually succumb to the onslaught of water.\n4. Choose the right shoes. For shorter backpacking trips, waterproof boots and gaiters are your best bet, while longer trips are best accomplished with breathable trail runners. If you\u2019re in the rain for long periods of time, your feet are going to get wet no matter what shoe you wear. Trail runners are easier on your feet and dry quicker than other options.\n5. Wear a hat. Your weakest link in staying warm is your head. Even with a hood, heat will escape from your head. Keep your head warm by wearing a hat. If you choose a hat that has a brim, you can also keep some of the rain off your face.\n6. Use a waterproof bag or use a pack cover. While they\u2019re expensive, waterproof bags far outrank pack covers in keeping your gear dry. A pack cover can easily be compromised by a wayward branch, which can pull off the cover. Additionally, water can still seep into the unprotected back of the bag. While a waterproof pack is preferable, a pack cover is better than nothing. Line the inside of your bag with a heavy-duty garbage bag.\n7. Protect your gear inside plastic bags. Protect items that need to stay dry, such as food, electronics, your map, your light source, etc. into plastic Ziplock bags, heavy-duty trash bags, or dry bags made for backpackers. If you are carrying a sleeping bag, tent, or other related items, make sure they are protected as well.\n8. Pack a set of dry clothes. If you\u2019re camping, make sure that you have a set of dry clothes to sleep in so that you can change out of your wet gear overnight. Not only will you be more comfortable, but it will help you keep your body temperature regulated. Store your dry clothes in plastic with your other dry gear.\n\n\n## Stay safe on rainy trail\n\n1. Choose a good trail. If you know that the weather will be rainy, choose an area that you can enjoy in the rain, such as a trek through the forest. Consider visibility and safety, since waterways can flood and rocks can become slippery. When in doubt, plan to keep your hiking short and bed down early.\n2. Avoid opening your pack. Each time you open your pack water drips in. Even if it\u2019s only a small amount of water, it can quickly compromise your pack. The water will remain in your waterproofed pack for the entire trek, so don\u2019t risk lugging around the unnecessary weight. Store frequently needed items and your snacks in pockets or in dry bags attached to the outside of your pack.\n3. Make sure that your map stays dry. If you don\u2019t have a waterproof map, then make sure that your map never gets wet. Ideally, it should be secured in a plastic see-through bag. Try not to remove it when it\u2019s exposed to rain.\n4. Snack often. Regularly munching on snacks will help you keep your body warmer, which is important when you\u2019re getting wet. Rain can cause hypothermia if you get too cool, so plan to eat more often than on a dry hike.\n5. Apply oils to your feet. The wetness from your socks can rub away your natural skin oils, which is what causes blisters. Applying a light salve to your feet can help prevent this from happening. Carry a salve and smooth it onto your feet when you settle in for the night.\n6. Stay hydrated. When it\u2019s raining, some hikers forget to drink their water. Even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty, make sure that you\u2019re sipping on your water to keep yourself hydrated. Dehydration can quickly become an issue.\n7. Take short breaks. Rainy weather makes breaks less desirable because it allows your body to cool down, causing you to be cold and uncomfortable. You also have the incentive to keep going until you reach your destination and can get out of the rain. However, not taking breaks can easily tire you out. Stay energized by taking shorter breaks than you normally would but more often. For example, if you would normally take a 15-minute break after hiking for an hour and a half, take a five-minute break every 30 minutes.\n8. Avoid placing wet gear in your tent. When you do stop to camp, keep your wet items separate from your dry items. Carrying wet gear into your tent can easily lead to everything being wet. Instead, cover up your gear and leave it outside the tent.\n9. Give your feet a chance to dry. When you stop to camp or to take an extended break, take off your shoes so that your feet have a chance to dry out. If you have dry socks, put them on. Otherwise, leave your feet bare. This will help keep your skin healthy and avoid blisters.\n10. Watch for the signs of hypothermia. Rain can lead to hypothermia, even if it\u2019s not very cold out. Stay safe by monitoring yourself for signs of hypothermia. If you do notice any, take steps to warm yourself, such as pitching camp and changing your wet clothes for dry ones. Symptoms of mild hypothermia include shivering, slurred speech, tiredness, cool or pale skin, and shallow breathing. Symptoms of moderate hypothermia include confusion, drowsiness, tiredness, shallow breathing, cold or pale skin, ceasing of shivering, and shedding clothes despite being cold.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Be certain that it doesn't restrict your dog\u2019s airflow \u2013 you should be able to fit two fingers between your dog\u2019s collar and neck. There should be a tag that ensures the dog does not have rabies and another with your name and phone number on it. A microchip is a tiny transponder that uses radiofrequency waves to transmit information on the chip about your pet when scanned. It is implemented painlessly just under the skin using a large-bore needle by veterinarians and some shelters. Once your dog has a microchip, you must register with the company the microchip is made by; now, if your dog arrives at a shelter, (s)he will be scanned and the microchip will give the shelter your phone number to contact you with. Your microchip must have recent contact information; if it does not, simply contact the microchip company to update your information.\n2. Brush up on your dog\u2019s training. Your dog should have basic obedience training, and should easily respond to you. The most vital commands to train are walking on a leash, \u201ccome,\u201d and \u201cleave it,\u201d in addition to crate training. If your puppy is young and hasn\u2019t been leash trained, and you intend to bring the dog to parades\/parties\/fireworks displays, now is the time to do this. For information on leash training, read this wikiHow article. Your recall command should be rock-solid. If your dog runs off in reaction to fireworks, or after an interesting smell, you must be able to recall him. A related command is \u201cstay\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. During parties or parades, your dog is likely to come across yummy food that\u2019s unhealthy for him to eat. To prevent him from eating anything he shouldn't, your \u201cleave it\u201d command should be very good. Another useful, related command is \u201cdrop it\u201d; for information on teaching this, read this article. A crate is a useful tool during 4th of July celebrations, serving both to safely contain the dog and often calm him\/her. For information on crate training, read this article.\n3. Plan your party carefully. Choose decorations carefully \u2013 glow sticks, which are both toxic for dogs and enticingly similar to colorful chew toys, are particularly dangerous. As beer and other human food and drink are toxic for dogs, decide on a place to keep your dog(s) during the party, such as in the house if the party is in the yard. If the dog is friendly and would like to stay with the people, consider keeping him with you leashed; contained by keeping him in a room with a baby gate barring passage if the party is inside; or securely tying him to a tree, fence, or other secure object if the party is outside. Before the party, research what foods are toxic to dogs. For information on avoiding foods toxic to dogs, read this article.\n4. Contact a veterinarian. For owners of dogs that are extremely reactive to fireworks or other typical Independence Day activities, the best option may be to discuss ways to help your dog with an experienced veterinarian. Topics to discuss include reducing stress for older dogs and the option of sedating the dog using safe drugs.\n5. Consider moving your dog. If your dog is extremely stressed by Independence Day activities, the best option may be to move him to another place for the duration of the celebrations or during the most active part (such as a parade). It may be possible to locate a \u201cdoggy hotel,\u201d friend or relative in a quiet rural area willing to keep the dog; however, expect there to be at least some amount of fireworks or parties, and it can be difficult to locate a business or person willing to care for your dog during the celebrations.\n6. Investigate products that may serve to calm your dog. A commercial product of \u201canxiety wrap,\u201d has been used with great success. Created by behavioral experts, such an item can calm dogs in a manner similar to swaddling an infant. A crate can be very useful, as stated above. As wolves naturally occupied dens, a dog will find comfort in his own \u201cden,\u201d or a crate. To increase the darkness, cover the crate with a blanket, leaving part of it uncovered so the dog can see passing people and breathe fresh air. It is possible to purchase relaxing auditory CDs that have been clinically researched to calm anxious dogs; these can be helpful for calming dogs frightened by Independence Day celebrations. Ask your veterinarian for more advice.\n\n\n## Party\n\n1. Secure your dog in the pre-decided place, if applicable. If he is going into a crate, place the crate in a quiet area of the house and put a safe bone, favorite toy, or other treats inside to occupy the dog. The dog will go in for the treat; once he or she is in, drape a dark-colored blanket over the crate to create darkness. Praise him and close windows and doors; you can also play a TV, radio, iPod, etc. to cover the sound of the party, or use the soothing music. If the dog is staying in the house, choose a room where the dog will be able to see the people but which people will not enter (for example, an office or study). Leave something to keep him occupied, and consider playing music\/etc.\n2. If the dog will be staying with you, keep him away from food. Avoid tables, where scraps can lay or food can sit tantalizingly close. If a guest offers your dog food, politely inform your guest that human food can be toxic for dogs and that you would prefer for your dog not to eat any. Guests, especially children, might ask you if they can walk or pet the dog; if they do, tell them that feeding the dog food is not allowed. Do not leave the dog unattended \u2013 this is particularly dangerous outside, where stray fireworks can land or the dog can bolt from if fireworks go off or there is another loud noise.\n3. Stay calm and alert. You\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for anything that could scare your dog, but keep in mind that your dog can sense your emotions and will often copy them. For example: If you\u2019re on edge and nervous, your dog will sense this and be on edge and nervous as well. Clearly, you can\u2019t control your guests\u2019 behavior, but take the following precautions:\n\t* Stay aware of the effect of the party\u2019s tone on your dog. If your dog starts to become anxious or overly active, the best option can be to put him in a separate room, crate, etc. Ask kids to play away from your dog. Children running around can be especially upsetting for a dog, and it\u2019s a good idea to ask any kids upsetting your dog to quiet down or play in a separate area.\n4. Watch out for stray fireworks. These are an unfortunate danger in places where fireworks have been set off or have been set off nearby, and it\u2019s wise to stay on guard for any, as fireworks are unpredictable and can be highly dangerous.\n\n\n## Parade\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don\u2019t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.\n2. Purchase or gather the supplies you may need. These include:\n\t* A crate for securing your dog. A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull. A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting. A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.\n3. Introduce your dog to the parade gradually. Though you likely won\u2019t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually \u2013 at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.\n4. Keep your dog under control. You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.\n5. Keep your dog as safe as possible. Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke \u2013 or even kill him \u2013 and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated. Read this article for information on treating heat stroke.\n\n\n## Firework show\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. As with parades, fireworks can be upsetting and even dangerous for dogs. Dogs who are startled by them can run off and escape, and, even if they have an up-to-date tag and microchip, are not guaranteed to be found or returned. Optionally, you can consult a veterinarian for information on drugging your dog, but in general, bringing your dog is discouraged, and should only be done if your dog:\n\t* Has heard fireworks before and did not strongly react to them;\n\t* Has an up-to-date tag and microchip;\n\t* Has basic obedience training; \u201ccome\u201d in particular must be rock-solid; and\n\t* Is calm around crowds, playing kids, other dogs, and various other features of fireworks.\n2. Gather your supplies. These are the same as in the section on parades.\n3. Train your dog. If your dog appears anxious, do not reassure him \u2013 this will reward him for bad behavior, as in essence he is receiving a yummy treat when he is afraid, telling him that he should be afraid. Instead, give him attention and a treat whenever he is calm; you are now telling him that being calm is good. Use small treats easily swallowed with a strong scent to distract the dog.\n4. Keep an eye on your dog. Signs of anxiety include the dog licking his lips, whimpering, a tense position, and showing the whites of his eyes; if these occur, quietly and calmly remove the dog from the situation. Keep your dog hydrated; bring along a collapsible water bowl and bottles of water and offer water to your dog occasionally. Keep in mind that he may be too stressed to drink \u2013 if this happens, the best option may be to remove your dog from the situation. If your dog is calm, you can distract him with treats, a Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter, a favorite toy, or any other desirable object.\n5. Be prepared to leave. If your dog is too stressed by the fireworks, the best option is to immediately leave for your home. If you\u2019re attending the fireworks with others, tell them in advance that you may have to leave if your dog becomes too anxious. At home, have a crate set up in the same manner described in the section on parties. Keep in mind that a car is not a safe option for putting your dog in, as the heat levels can kill him\/her; instead, the safest option is to leave with your dog and place him in the crate. Once he\u2019s settled in, you can return to the fireworks and have fun.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

Determine which type of deal is right for you. Groupon started by offering daily deals that required a \"tipping point,\" or a certain number of buyers before the deal was actually active. They've found that tipping point was always reached, so they've done away with it. They've also expanded from the simple 1-deal-a-day approach. Here's an overview of what they offer.\n2. The Featured Deal. This is the traditional deal Groupon became known for. It works like this:\n\t* Consult. Work with your Groupon representative to create a custom offer that meets your business needs. Plan. Create an action plan to help your staff deal with the rush of new customers. Launch.

Rather than the printed voucher many may bring using the Featured Deal, the voucher will be on their phone. Visit the What It Looks Like page to see how a deal is structured on a smart phone.\n4. Groupon Rewards. This program offers rewards to your best customers based on your specifications.

{"instruction":"How to dress nice every day (for girls)?","response":"Dressing nicely each day can take some effort but will ultimately be worth it if your outfits make you feel confident and happy. If you want to look great every day, you will first have to go through your wardrobe and fill it with classic outfit staples. Looking awesome also involves some planning and accessorizing that may take some getting used to but will ultimately result in some stylish outfits.\n\n## Fill your wardrobe\n\n1. Buy classic pieces. To dress nicely, it is important to have some classic pieces in your wardrobe that will never go out of style. Classic pieces are articles of clothing that are generally not too extreme or dated. Instead, they are generally simple and elegant, like a navy blue blazer or a well-crafted black V-neck t-shirt. Though they may sound simple, you can always dress these pieces up with accessories. Basic, classic pieces are generally easier to mix and match, which means that they can be used in a variety of outfits.\n2. Purchase a few accent articles of clothing. To go along with your classic articles of clothing, buy some accent pieces that will make your outfits pop, even if they are simple. These accents could be bright colors that you don\u2019t normally wear or patterns that pop. For example, you could take an outfit that is as simple as a white t-shirt and a navy blue skirt, and make it interesting with a patterned sweater.\n3. Purchase clothes that you can mix and match. When going through your wardrobe, consider whether or not you can use each article of clothing in at least two different outfits. Mixing and matching is an important part of dressing nicely everyday. While you most likely can\u2019t purchase a new outfit for every day of the week, you can buy clothing that you can mix and match to create entirely new and exciting outfits.\n4. Consider your body when picking out your clothes. Certain clothes have cuts that look different on different body types. Look for clothes that flatter your body and make you feel confident. Each person has their idea of what they find flatters their bodies the most, so spend some time trying on different kinds of clothes. For example:\n\t* If you have a \u2018Pear\u2019 shape, which means that you have wider hips and a slimmer bust, you could try out an open-neck top, or a dress with an empire waist.\n5. Get rid of clothes that are worn or torn. Part of dressing nicely means giving away or selling old clothes. Clothes get worn out, especially if you wear the same piece a lot, and worn-out clothing does not necessarily look very classy\u2014unless you are going for a look that involves faded clothes and torn jeans. If you find that a shirt has a stain, try your best to get it out, but if the stain remains, it might be time to toss the shirt. Clothes with stains tend to look a little sloppy.\n6. Consider your skin tone when buying your clothes. Picking out clothing that complements your skin tone can make a great outfit that much nicer. Of course, always keep in mind that if you don\u2019t like a color or don\u2019t feel like it looks good on you, don\u2019t wear it. Part of dressing nicely is dressing in things that make you confident and happy; if a certain color matches your skin tone, but you don\u2019t like it anyway, don\u2019t wear it. General guidelines for skin tones and clothing colors include:\n\t* Very light skin tones: Ice tones, pale pinks, greys, baby blues, navies, and grass greens. Medium-light skin tones: Pastel colors, cool reds, and blues. Avoid orange. Medium skin tones: Metallic tones, jewel tones, plums, wine reds, bright blues, deep purples. Medium-dark skin tones: Deep colors like dark greens, bright blues, pale yellows, warm reds. Very dark skin tones: Bright colors like burgundies, cobalt blue, bright orange, and red.\n7. Hang up your clothes and invest in an iron. Another part of dressing nicely is keeping your clothes in tip-top shape. This means hanging up clothes when you can, and ironing folded clothes. If you are not sure how to iron your clothes, click here. You can also try steam pressing your clothes.\n\n\n## Plan your outfit\n\n1. Plan your outfits. One aspect of dressing nicely is taking the time to plan your outfits. This might mean planning your outfit the night before, or planning an entire week\u2019s worth of outfits at the beginning of the week; go with what works best for you. Trying to figure out a great outfit in the morning before school may make you feel a little too stressed, so take some time to consider your wardrobe and try on several different outfits that you could wear. Some girls find that trying out outfits and taking photos of the ones that they like to put in a binder can help them to decide on an outfit when they are in a rush. If you plan a last-minute outing with your friends, simply flip through the binder and pick out a pre-planned outfit.\n2. Consider the occasion you are dressing for. When planning your outfit, think about what you will be doing in that outfit. Different events call for different kinds of clothing. For instance, if you\u2019re going to school, try not to show too much skin, or wear a shirt that is too low cut. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to the beach with your friends, wearing a summery dress and shoes you can walk through the sand with maybe the way to go. If you are not sure what would be appropriate to wear to a certain event, such as a cousin's baptism, or a job interview, don\u2019t be afraid to ask friends or family for advice.\n3. Wear clothing that makes you feel confident. When picking out your outfit, make sure that you feel good in your clothes. Ultimately, you should be dressing nicely for yourself rather than dressing for anyone else. It is important to feel comfortable and happy in the clothes that you are wearing; projecting confidence and enthusiasm will give your outfit that extra, energetic boost. Try to keep in mind that if someone only likes you when you are dressed up, that person might not have their priorities straight. First and foremost, dress the way that you want to dress.\n4. Try to avoid combining patterns. While you may be able to get away with some very subtle pattern combinations, it is generally a good idea to only have one pattern in your outfit. Clashing patterns can often make an outfit look sloppy. For instance, if you were wearing an argyle sweater, you would most likely want to avoid wearing that sweater with a striped skirt.\n5. Consider using the rule of three. If you are having trouble putting together an outfit, using the \u2018rule of three\u2019 can help you to create a quick but elegant ensemble in no time. When using the rule of three, pick out three colors: two that will be your base colors (most likely your shirt and pants or skirt) and one that will be your accent color. Your base colors could be subtler colors that go together well, such as a navy blue shirt and camel skirt. Your accent color should be a brighter color that makes the rest of your outfit pop, such as a red thin belt or a silver-laced scarf.\n6. Try to wear something extra cute at least once a week. While you may want to look nice every day of the week, throwing on an outfit that dazzles once a week can help to make you feel that much more well-dressed. Take the time to come up with this eye-catching ensemble.\n7. Try to avoid wearing the same outfit twice in a week. While this will not be possible if you have to wear a school uniform, or a uniform for work, try to avoid wearing the same outfit two times a week if you are planning on hanging out or being seen by the same people. If you have two different parties to go to, however, and the people at these parties won\u2019t overlap, feel free to consider wearing the same great outfit. By no means does this mean that you avoid wearing the same article of clothing twice a week. If you have a skirt that works well in two different outfits, feel free to rock both of these ensembles in the same week. Remember, mixing and matching is the key to making you feel like you have an endless wardrobe.\n8. Create an emergency outfit. Some days, you might find that you just don\u2019t want to wear the outfit you have planned. On those days, it's important to have an emergency backup outfit. This outfit should be simple, comfortable, and easy to accessorize with. For example, your emergency outfit could be a pair of nice jeans, a tank top in your favorite color, and a cropped sweater. With these basic items already put together, all you need to go is add a necklace, scarf, or rocking pair of shoes and you\u2019ll be good to go.\n\n\n## Accessorizing\n\n1. Pick out some shoes that will look classy. If you are shopping for shoes, try to pick out a couple of pairs that can be worn with most of your outfits. These could be classic black flats, a nice pair of boots, or short wedges that you can wear with your skirts and dresses. Try on the shoes and make sure you can walk in them easily; if you are planning on wearing them with many of your outfits, it\u2019s important to be able to walk in them.\n2. Wear shoes that would for the occasion. As with your clothes, consider the event you are going to when picking out the shoes you will wear that day. In certain formal events, sandals might not be appropriate, while wearing high heels at school might make it hard to get from class to class on time.\n3. Keep your shoes looking brand new. If your shoes get damaged or scuffed, try to buff the marks out, or use polishes to make your shoes look shiny and new again. Part of looking nice is being dressed well\u2014from your head to your feet. If you are not sure how to clean your shoes, take a look at some of the following articles:\n\t* Shine shoes\n\t* Polish shoes\n\t* Wash shoes\n4. Try out different kinds of jewelry. Accessorizing can help to take your outfit to a whole new level. When creating outfits for yourself, try on different kinds of jewelry and see how they change or affect the outfit you are wearing. Sometimes, adding a statement necklace or chandelier earrings can take your outfit from nice to outstanding. However, try not to over-accessorize. For example, if you are planning on wearing a chunky necklace, try wearing a small pair of stud earrings, rather than a pair of dangling earrings that could make your jewelry feel overbearing.\n5. Consider where you want the focus to be when accessorizing. Jewelry can draw a person\u2019s eye, which can be both a great thing and an unwanted thing. For example, if you want your focus to be on your face, wear large or dangling earrings. If you want the focus to be on the rest of your outfit, consider wearing a longer necklace that ties your whole outfit together. However, if you are wearing a low-cut shirt, try to refrain from wearing a longer necklace, as it might draw too much attention to your chest area.\n6. Try out different kinds of accessories. Accessories are not just limited to jewelry and shoes. You can spice up an outfit by adding an accent scarf, a colorful belt, or a stylish hat. Play around with different kinds of accessories that fit into your style.\n7. Create your own \u2018golden rule\u2019. The \u2018golden rule\u2019 refers to the maximum number of accessories you will allow yourself. This is completely based on your own opinion. Some people like to layer necklaces and wear funky shoes. Others, prefer a chic minimalist style in which you choose one or two accessories that compliment your outfit. Remember that you can change your golden rule when you feel like it doesn\u2019t reflect your personality anymore. For instance, maybe you like wearing three necklaces and a bunch of bracelets, but during the year your preferences chance and you decide to limit yourself to three accessories; go with what will make you feel happy and confident.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to study using a game method?","response":"## Play the concentration game\n\n1. Create game pieces. Make small cards using paper or something sturdier such as cardstock. Cut small squares out and be sure to make each piece the same size. Since this is a memory game, it is important that each card looks the same so you are unable to differentiate one card from the next.\n2. Write out information on game pieces. Work in pairs when writing out your review information on these cards. Write down a vocabulary word on the first card in the pair and its definition on the second. Continue writing on your cards until each review item has been covered. This game words best when reviewing things like definitions, spelling, examples, etc.\n3. Organize your cards. Flip over all your cards so that the writing is underneath. Place your cards face down and organize them into rows and columns until every game piece is situated.\n4. Flip over one card. Begin the game by choosing just one card to turn over. Read the definition or vocabulary word and choose one more card to turn over. If you flipped over the correct card, you should have a pair in which both cards are a match. When first starting out, this game is sheer luck, but after a few tries you will be able to remember where each card lies and can do your best to find its correct match.\n5. Set aside pairs. When you have found two cards that are a match, set that pair aside so that your game board becomes smaller. Continue playing until every card has been turned over and you have created matches for each game piece. When you are finished playing, you can simply shuffle your cards and redistribute them to create your game board and play again.\n\n\n## Play with card\n\n1. Obtain a deck of cards. The first thing you need to do is get an entire deck of cards. Be sure you aren\u2019t missing any because it will affect how you play the game.\n2. Create a list of review items. Using your study materials, create a list of items you want to review. This list must be numbered and can be anything from definitions to vocabulary.\n3. Pull out face cards from your deck. You want to eliminate any face cards from your deck because the only cards needed are those with numbers. You may set the face cards aside until you have finished playing. An alternative to pulling out face cards is using them to play the game. Treat these cards like wild cards and whenever you draw one you can choose to review any item from your list that you wish to review.\n4. Shuffle your cards. It is very important to shuffle your deck. By doing this, you will ensure that each review item gets chosen by mixing up the numbers within the deck.\n5. Draw cards. Place your cards in a pile after shuffling them and draw the first card off the top. You may set aside all the cards you have already drawn.\n6. Review information corresponding to the number on each card. Look at the number on the card you drew and find the corresponding number on your list of review items. Review the information for that particular number. Continue to draw cards and review the information corresponding to those cards until you have gone through the entire deck.\n\n\n## Play a guess game\n\n1. Create a list of questions. Before generating a list of game questions, you must first go through all of your study materials and review critical information. While reviewing, form questions and produce a list.\n2. Cut small pieces of paper. Once your list is created you are ready to craft several pieces of small paper. These pieces of paper will serve as the main game pieces. Use card stock or heavy-duty paper for sturdy game pieces. Use sticky notes as another option to quickly create piece.\n3. Number papers. You created your main game pieces so now you must number them according to how many questions you developed.\n4. Put papers in container. Place all of your numbered game pieces into the container and be careful not to forget any. Be sure to shake the container once you\u2019ve put all your game pieces inside to ensure the pieces are mixed sufficiently.\n5. Draw paper from container. Keep your list of questions next to you as you pull pieces out of the container. Choose randomly from the container and read the number on the piece of paper.\n6. Answer corresponding questions. Find the number on your question list that corresponds to the number on your game piece and read that question.\n7. Set aside used pieces. After answering each question, put the used game pieces aside so as not to repeat any. If you are unable to recall the correct answers to any questions you can make two piles designating one for challenging questions and one for easy questions. When you play the game for again, you can just put the challenging questions inside the container and spend less time reviewing the questions you already know.\n8. Repeat steps until container is empty. Continue draw the papers from the container until you\u2019ve used them all. To play again, simply fill up the container and start over.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to dress for a 90s party?","response":"At the moment, 1990s-themed parties are hugely popular and can be immensely fun if you show up in the right outfit. Start by doing some research into popular celebrities and film or TV characters from the decade to get a sense for the fashions of the 90s. Then decide whether you want to copy an iconic look or riff off a popular trend. Choose one of the decade\u2019s overarching trends and try to emulate the trend\u2019s color palette and overall silhouettes in your outfit. Once you\u2019re dressed the part, \u201cparty like it\u2019s 1999\u201d!\n\n## Recreate a 90s grunge look\n\n1. Opt for drab, slouchy clothes. Create an outfit made up of dark, murky colors and oversized garments. Try pairing baggy ripped jeans with a slouchy striped sweater in drab hues. Or throw an oversized, boxy leather jacket over a lived-in t-shirt featuring your favorite 90s grunge band. Look to Kurt Cobain for grunge inspiration. You could also try a slouchy top half with an acid-wash miniskirt and shredded tights for a more girly take on grunge. Finish off your look with long stringy hair and add some red eye makeup under your eyes to get that exhausted grunge appearance.\n2. Mix in satin, lace, and floral prints for a romantic grunge look. Try a more glamorous take on grunge by assembling an outfit inspired by Courtney Love. Start with a feminine piece like a lace-trimmed satin slip dress or a cotton floral-printed dress. Then layer grunge elements over it. Drape an oversized cardigan or plaid flannel shirt over your dress and accessorize with chokers and chains and combat boots. Add smudged black eyeliner and deep red lipstick to complete your look.\n3. Don\u2019t forget to add an oversized plaid flannel shirt to your outfit. These shirts were a staple in 90s grunge. The oversized flannel plaid button-down can be worn with practically anything. Just be sure to pick one that\u2019s about 3 sizes too big and that features dull, drab colors. Throw your flannel shirt over a lived-in graphic t-shirt or a feminine dress. Or tie it around your waist for a casual, careless look.\n4. Incorporate acid-wash denim into your look. Opt for light- or medium-wash hues and acid or stonewashed textures. Try using it sparingly with 1 garment, like an oversized denim jacket or ripped baggy jeans. If you have time to do some DIY-ing, try creating a patchwork denim dress or skirt. If you want to really make an entrance, go all-out with a head-to-toe denim outfit. Acid-wash denim can also be glammed up with silver-toned accessories and more formal silhouettes. Look up the iconic denim outfits worn by Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake to see what\u2019s possible.\n5. Finish off your grunge look with a pair of combat boots. Whether you\u2019re wearing baggy bottoms or black tights slip into a pair of combat boots. Aim for shoes in the style of Doc Martens or Timberland. Try a pair of second-hand shoes \u2013 the more worn-in, the better.\n\n\n## Dress like a 90s prep\n\n1. Start with bold plaid suiting. For guys, this means choosing plaid trousers or a boxy plaid sports jacket with roomy trousers. For women, pick a bold-colored tweed or plaid blazer and pleated miniskirt to achieve the schoolgirl look that was prevalent in the 90s. Add over-the-knee white socks and Mary Jane shoes to a plaid miniskirt. For a sassier schoolgirl look, try a white crop top or tied button-down under the blazer to show off your belly button. Model your outfit after the costumes in Clueless or Britney Spears\u2019 \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d look. You can either recreate one of these iconic costumes or pick out elements to inspire an original outfit.\n2. Mix brightly-colored tops, bottoms, and sunglasses. The fashion of the 1990s contained some holdovers from the 1980s, most notably the saturated, fluorescent colors and prints. Work these into your preppy outfit with a color-blocked windbreaker. Or pair a bold-colored top with equally saturated trousers in a clashing color. Accessorize with Oakley-style sunglasses with slim oval or rectangular rims featuring tinted lenses. Play with color combinations like orange and pink, yellow and blue, or red and purple. For a masculine high school prep look, wear an oversized letterman jacket, a pastel-colored polo with a popped collar, and pastel trousers. Alternatively, try creating a more casual and youthful outfit with all of this color, like those worn in Saved By the Bell.\n3. Try an oversized button-down and trousers for a take on 90s business casual. Graduate your preppy look to a yuppie one and riff on the decade\u2019s emerging business casual look. Pair pleated trousers with a boxy sports jacket, or choose chinos and an oversized but tucked-in dress shirt with bright vertical stripes. Opt for a black crewneck t-shirt under a boxy sports jacket. Re-watch Friends and pay close attention to the workwear outfits shown.\n\n\n## Follow 90s urban trend\n\n1. Choose bold and baggy pieces for a hip-hop or R&B-inspired outfit. Artists of the time mixed brightly colored African-influenced prints with high-end sportswear and baggy bottoms and jackets. For a men\u2019s outfit, combine these influences in an all-oversized look. For a women\u2019s outfit, pair baggier pieces with fitted pieces to nail the look while showing off your curves. Get inspired by the outfits worn by girl groups like TLC or Salt-N-Pepa or male soloists like Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur. As a woman, try either pairing a baggy jacket with slim leggings or a crop top with loose-fitting cargo pants. Accessorize with big hoop earrings or a bandana.\n2. Choose athletic pieces like track gear and chunky sneakers. Air Jordans were huge at the time, so pick out a pair of flashy, bulky sneakers. Try a muscle tank or a zip-up track jacket with stripes running down the sleeves. Beyond hip-hop artists, quite a few 90s boy bands sported the athletic-inspired outfits. Check out photos of Dream Street for reference. Rep your favorite team with a swishy starter jacket or old sports jersey. Women can get the look by slightly altering the silhouette. Try a high ponytail and a fitted crop top over low-slung track pants and platform sneakers \u00e0 la Sporty Spice.\n3. Top off your outfit with a 90s bucket hat, snapback hat, or scrunchie. Popular 90s headgear crossed the boundaries from hip-hop to preppy, so feel free to experiment. Bucket hats are great for masculine and feminine looks alike. Try a snapback for a more masculine effect or a scrunchie to make your outfit more girly. Tie your hair up in a high ponytail or 2 pigtails with a colorful scrunchie. To get an authentic-looking 90s outfit, pick up a snapback hat from the decade itself. Consider wearing your snapback hat backward with the adjustable strap at your forehead. Choose a classic bucket hat in a solid-color canvas, or go wild with a plaid or fuzzy-textured bucket hat.\n4. Accessorize with chains. Try a chain belt slung low on the hips over flared denim. For a more masculine look, wear a thick chain connected to your belt loop and wallet. You can lean towards bling with elaborate gold chains. Or keep your look grungey with heavy silver-toned or gunmetal chains.\n\n\n## Sport 90s mainstream and high fashion\n\n1. Choose loud prints and graphics to recall casual 90s apparel. In the 90s, practically no print was off-limits. Play around with animal prints, paisley, small florals, plaid, Hawaiian florals, and camouflage. Or throw on a baggy graphic t-shirt featuring your favorite 90s bans or TV show. Skate culture blew up in the 90s. Try a skater-inspired t-shirt and look to characters like Travis in Clueless for ideas. Try camo and animal prints in either natural colors or bold, saturated hues.\n2. Wear flares, halter tops, and flashy fabrics to nail the 90s disco revival. Just as the 1990s are being revived in the 2010s, the 1970s were being revived in the 1990s! This revealed itself through halter tops, flared jeans, platform shoes, and materials like sequins and colorful pleather. For women, try a pair of hip-hugging flare jeans with a cropped halter top to get the best of the-90s-does-the-70s fashion.\n3. Try a metallic mini-dress for supermodel-inspired evening attire. Before the year 2000 (Y2K), space- and tech-inspired silvery, frosted colors and fabrics were popular. Recreate this look with a shiny silver or frosted pastel dress. Look for one with tank or spaghetti straps and either an empire waist or a shift dress silhouette. Add maribou trim to your dress\u2019 hemline to get even more in the 90s mood. Try pairing pastel platform heels or strappy silver stilettos with your dress. Look at photos of supermodels like Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, as well as the iconic party dresses worn in Romy and Michele, for inspiration.\n4. Accessorize with popular 90s jewelry items like chokers and mood rings. For women, pick out a black plastic stretchy choker to add some 90s sass to your outfit. Slip on a color-changing mood ring to really get in the mood. Piercings were popular during the 90s, so slip on a fake belly-button ring (for ladies) or a small stud or hoop (for guys) if you don\u2019t already have a piercing. Sport a brightly colored and patterned snap bracelet on your wrist. Add a hemp bracelet or choker to a slouchy masculine outfit.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to solve the shakespeare puzzle in silent hill 3?","response":"Silent Hill 3 is the third installment in the Silent Hill video game series. It is considered to be a survival horror video game in which your character must solve different puzzles and psychological challenges in order to advance. The Shakespeare puzzle can be found during the Shopping Center stage. It\u2019s inside a bookstore called My Bestsellers.\n\n## Solve the puzzle on easy mode\n\n1. Pick up the Shakespeare books that have fallen on the ground. In this difficulty, there will only be 2 books on the ground: Anthology 1 and Anthology 3.\n2. Examine the bookshelf. You\u2019ll be allowed to place the books you found on the floor in the empty slots.\n3. Click on Anthology 1 and place it on the first slot of the bookshelf.\n4. Click on Anthology 3 and place it on the third slot on the bookshelf. A code will appear after placing the two books correctly.\n5. Use the code on the door at the back side of the bookstore. In this puzzle, you only need to arrange the books in the proper order: (from left to right) Anthology 1, Anthology 2, Anthology 3, Anthology 4, and then Anthology 5.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on normal mode\n\n1. Read the note on the door. It will read \u201cFair is foul, and foul is fair. Put these books out of order.\u201d\n2. Pick up all the books on the floor. There will be 5 books in normal mode.\n3. Examine the bookshelf. You\u2019ll be allowed to place the books on the empty space on the shelf. Put the books in randomly; order doesn\u2019t matter as this puzzle is generated randomly.\n4. Take a good look at the books. You\u2019ll see there are black markings on it; this is the code you need.\n5. Arrange the books until you get the correct order. It won\u2019t be too hard as the numbers are written quite obviously. Try to make out the numbers written on the spine of the books and keep moving them until you get it right.\n\n\n## Solve the puzzle on hard mode\n\n1. Know the title of each anthology book. In order to find the title of the book, you\u2019ll need to open your inventory and choose to examine the book. Anthology 1 is Romeo and Juliet\n\t* Anthology 2 is King Lear\n\t* Anthology 3 is Macbeth\n\t* Anthology 4 is Hamlet\n\t* Anthology 5 is Othello\n2. Decipher the first stanza of the clue. This stanza mentions \u201cThe first words at thy left hand.\u201d\n\t* This is an instruction for solving the puzzle; meaning you\u2019ll need to arrange the books from left to right.\n3. Place Anthology 4 on the first spot on the left side of the bookshelf. The first stanza mentions \u201cfalse lunacy\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible words,\u201d which is a reference to the plot of Hamlet.\n4. Place Anthology 1 on the second spot of the bookshelf. The second stanza is the easiest to decipher \u201cplaying at death\u201d and \u201cnameless lover\u201d refers to the last part of Romeo and Juliet.\n5. Place Anthology 5 on the third spot on the bookshelf. This stanza is a reference to Othello, referring to the innocence of Desdemona and the lies of Iago.\n6. Place Anthology 2 on the fourth spot on the bookshelf. This stanza refers to the story of King Lear, where his daughter Cordelia refuses to speak about how much she loves her father as opposed to the false flattery of her sisters.\n7. Place Anthology 3 on the last spot on the bookshelf. And with all 5 books on the bookshelf you would have the correct code.\n8. Decipher the last clue. 41523 is not the pass code; on the sixth stanza, you will be instructed to more. \u201c41523\u2014One vengeful man spilled blood for two\u201d (Hamlet). This means you will have to double Hamlet, which is Anthology 4. Now our code is 81523. \u201c81523\u2014Two youths shed tears for 3\u201d; this refers to Romeo and Juliet, so you must replace 1 with 3. Our code now is 83523. Finally, \u201c3 witches disappear\u201d (reference to Macbeth), which is Anthology 3. You\u2019ll have to remove it from the code. The final pass code is 8352.\n9.

{"instruction":"How to get rid of neck acne?","response":"Neck acne can be as frustrating as acne on your face. The skin on your neck is thicker than the skin on your face (the acne that appears here is more like body acne than face acne) and may produce more oil, sometimes leading to more severe acne or cystic lesions. The best way to get rid of neck acne is with a good cleansing routine and an occasional skin treatment. If your acne does not improve within a few months or if it appears infected, then you should see a doctor for help.\n\n## Cleanse your neck\n\n1. Wash your neck at least twice a day. Keeping your neck clean is the best way to start getting rid of neck acne. You should take a shower to wash your neck at least once per day. If you sweat a lot, such as after a workout, then take another shower.\n2. Use a gentle cleanser to clean your neck. Find a gentle cleanser that is labeled as \u201cnon-comedogenic\u201d or \u201coil-free\u201d to use on your neck. Products that are non-comedogenic will not clog your pores so they should help to clear up your neck acne. Check the label to be sure that a product is non-comedogenic. Check to make sure that the products you buy are alcohol-free as well. Alcohol may irritate your neck acne and make it worse.\n3. Apply cleanser to your neck using only your fingers. Do not use a washcloth, sponge, or other abrasive materials to apply cleanser to your neck because this can cause irritation, scarring, and worsen the existing acne. Instead, use your fingertips to gently apply the cleanser to your neck. Do not scrub aggressively. Rinse your neck well after you finish washing it. Pat your neck dry with a clean cotton towel.\n4. Avoid irritants. You may not realize it, but your clothing or accessories may be contributing to your neck acne and making it worse. Avoid tight collared shirts, scarves, and turtlenecks, as these may irritate the acne. Make sure anything that touches your neck is clean. Also, avoid touching the area and never pick at or scratch your acne, as this can cause scarring. Try not to use oily sunscreens and don't cover the acne with foundation or makeup. If you use a hairstyling product, make sure it doesn't come in contact with your neck. If you have long hair, the oil from your hair may be getting on the back of your neck. Try wearing your hair up in a ponytail while you treat your acne.\n\n\n## Use a sea salt treatment\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Making a sea salt treatment is easy and the ingredients are available in most grocery stores. It exfoliates your skin and can dry out acne. To make a sea salt treatment, you will need:\n\t* 1 cup hot water\n\t* 1 teaspoon sea salt\n\t* Green tea bag and\/or 1 \u2013 2 tablespoons aloe vera\n2. Brew a cup of green tea. Green tea extract has been found to be effective as a treatment for acne, but using a cup of green tea as a base for this treatment should also help. You can either use one teaspoon of green tea leaves in a tea infuser or use a green tea bag. Place the tea bag or infuser into a mug. Then, boil some water and pour about 1 cup of water over the green tea. Let the tea steep for about three minutes and then remove the tea bag or infuser.\n3. Dissolve 1 teaspoon of sea salt in the tea. Measure out 1 teaspoon of sea salt and add it to the cup of tea. Stir the sea salt until it completely dissolves in the tea.\n4. Add a tablespoon of aloe vera. Aloe vera has been found to be effective against acne and it also has moisturizing properties. You can add this instead of the tea, or try combining the green tea and aloe vera into one mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of aloe vera to the sea salt solution and stir well. If you want to skip the green tea and only use aloe vera, mix 2 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 1 tablespoon of sea salt. This will make a scrub that you can apply directly to your neck.\n5. Apply the mixture to your neck. Make sure that the solution is not so hot that it might burn your neck. Allow it to cool down a bit first. Then, you can apply the solution by soaking a clean cotton washcloth in the solution and placing the cloth over your neck. If you only have few places that you want to treat, then you can dip a cotton swab or cotton ball into the solution and apply it as needed.\n6. Leave the solution on for about five minutes. Don\u2019t leave the sea salt solution on your skin any longer or it may dry out your skin too much. After time is up, rinse off your neck with lukewarm water and gently dry off your neck with a clean, cotton towel.\n7. Moisturize your neck. After the sea salt treatment, apply some moisturizer to your neck. Make sure that you use a non-comedogenic moisturizer to avoid making the acne worse.\n8. Repeat the sea salt treatment once per day. Do not use this treatment more than once per day or you may dry out your skin too much, even if you moisturize after. Limit yourself to one sea salt treatment per day.\n\n\n## Use an egg white mask\n\n1. Gather your ingredients. Some of the things you can readily find in your kitchen are thought to have antibacterial and healing properties, allowing you to quickly whip up an acne-fighting mask. You will need:\n\t* 1\/2 tablespoon of dark colored honey (darker honey has more antibacterial properties)\n\t* 1 egg white (do not use the yolk)\n\t* 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice\n2. Combine the ingredients in a small bowl. Use a whisk or fork to mix the egg white and lemon juice until it becomes frothy, then add the honey. Make sure that everything is well combined. You may wish to add other household items, such as 1 teaspoon of witch hazel (which has anti-inflammatory properties) or a few drops of an essential oil like peppermint, spearmint, lavender, or calendula, but it is unclear if these will enhance or reduce the effectiveness of the treatment.\n3. Spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat your whole neck, then you can use your fingers to spread the paste over your neck. If you want to treat a smaller area, then you can use a cotton swab or cotton ball to spread the paste over specific problem areas.\n4. Allow the paste to dry on your neck and then rinse. Leave the paste alone for about 15 minutes, then rinse it away with lukewarm water. You may need to hop in the shower to do this. Use your fingers to break up the paste as you rinse it away. Pat your skin dry and then apply a non-comedogenic moisturizer to complete the treatment.\n\n\n## Treat neck acne with medication\n\n1. Try over-the-counter treatments. Face washes and topical treatments containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, or resorcinol acid are all effective acne-fighters and are available over-the-counter. You may find products targeted specifically at treating body acne, which may be more effective than products meant to be used on your face. Just make sure you don't forget and use the body product on the delicate skin of your face or the front of your neck.\n2. Ask about retinoid creams. Retinoid creams can help to unclog your pores and eliminate acne on your neck, but you will need to get a prescription from your doctor or dermatologist.\n3. Discuss the use of antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe a prescription-strength topical antibiotic, such as clindamycin, to apply to your neck, which kills acne-causing bacteria. It may also reduce redness. You will need to apply it twice daily and combine it with benzoyl peroxide, as this prevents the bacteria from becoming immune to the antibiotic.\n4. Talk to your doctor about oral contraceptive pills if you are a woman. Oral contraceptives can help to reduce acne in some women, but only if the acne is related to shifts in your hormones. Keep in mind that oral contraceptives have side effects and they should not be used if you are planning to become pregnant.\n5. Consider steroid injections for cystic acne. If your dermatologist determines that the acne on the back of your neck is a nodular or cystic lesion, your doctor may decide to inject the lesion directly with a steroid. This can quickly reduce swelling and heal the acne. It may also reduce scarring. Side effects of this treatment include thinning of the skin, increased sensitivity to light, and may temporarily case the fat under your skin to atrophy, giving the area a \"sunken\" appearance.\n6. Consider isotretinoin for severe acne. Isotretinoin is a strong medicine that should only be used if other methods of controlling acne fail to work. Isotretinoin can clear up severe acne in a couple of months, but it also has some severe risks including:\n\t* Ulcerative colitis\n\t* Liver damage\n\t* Inflammatory bowel disease\n\t* Depression\n\t* Bone changes\n\t* Severe birth defects\n7. Look into laser treatments for acne. Laser treatments can also help to get rid of acne by reducing the size of oil glands and making them less active as well. Some forms of laser therapy also use topical medicine to make the laser more effective. Keep in mind that you will need multiple treatments in order for laser therapy to work.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to get a babysitting license?","response":"Babysitting is an important job. Whether you are a teenager looking to make some extra cash or an adult looking to do child care as your profession, babysitting certifications can help. Courses or online programs can give younger babysitters the knowledge and credentials necessary to gain clients and become skilled babysitters.\n\n## Take class at the red cross\n\n1. Contact your local Red Cross Center. Most Red Cross centers across the United States offer courses in \u201cBabysitting Basics,\u201d \u201cBabysitting Training,\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Child Care.\u201d The Red Cross is a nationally-recognized and widely respected organization, so it is an excellent choice for babysitting training courses.\n2. Select the course that is right for you. The \u201cBabysitting Training\u201d course is the most extensive and effective option. This on-site class last for 7 hours over the course of 1 day. \u201cBabysitting basics\u201d and \u201cAdvanced Child Care\u201d are both online courses. Each lasts for 4 hours, and can be completed at your own pace. Babysitting Training is recommended for students aged 11-15. Babysitting Basics is intended for students 11 and up. Advanced Child Care does not carry an age requirement, but is geared toward experienced babysitters.\n3. Pay the appropriate fee. The \u201cBabysitting Training\u201d course, once again, is the most comprehensive overview. The fee for this course is $85. The \u201cBabysitting Basics\u201d online course is $29. The \u201cAdvanced Child Care\u201d course costs $49, although it is sometimes on sale at half-price (for $24.50). These fees are due at the time of registration.\n4. Attend the class. If you have signed up for the \u201cBabysitting Training\u201d course, make your way to your local Red Cross center on the date of your course. Students are instructed to bring a lunch. If you have registered for one of the online courses, log in and begin working whenever you have a couple of hours to dedicate to learning. When you have completed the course, you will receive a certificate. The Babysitting Training course focuses on developing leadership skills, developing a babysitting business, keeping kids safe and helping children behave, and learning about basic child care and basic first aid. The Babysitting Basics class focuses on staying safe, what to do in an emergency, selecting age-appropriate activities, and handling a variety of behaviors. The Advanced Babysitting course focuses on how to take care of children outside of the home. It teaches students how to keep children safe and happy in a variety of situations. You will not need to pass a test. Simply complete the course to earn your certificate.\n5. Take a CPR and First Aid class. Although it is not required, it is strongly encouraged for all babysitters to take a course in CPR and First Aid. These courses are also offered through the Red Cross. Certifications in CPR and First Aid increase make you a more hireable babysitter. The Red Cross Adult and Pediatric First Aid\/CPR class meets for 6.5 hours. The cost is $110. The certification you earn will be good for 2 years.\n\n\n## Complete an online course\n\n1. Find an online babysitting course. Numerous online agencies offer courses in babysitting. Look for an online training course geared toward your needs (such as infant care or early childhood development). Search for an option that fits your budget. Many childcare licensing agencies offer free babysitting courses. Check your local childcare licensing agency\u2019s website or call and ask if they have any upcoming courses. Free courses generally do not grant \"certificates,\" however, they may still offer valuable knowledge. Online babysitting courses range from as low as $20 to as high as $200.\n2. Verify that this source is reputable. Although there are many online options for babysitting classes, not all of them may be worthwhile. Look for a company with positive online reviews as well as testimonials from clients. Also, look for a contact telephone number, call them, and ask them some questions over the phone. A company that you cannot reach by phone is probably not a good choice.\n3. Make sure you meet the requirements. Some training programs are geared towards students of a specific age. For example, some are created for young adults (usually ages 11-15), while others are for older students. Additionally, some course like you to already have a background in childcare, while others are for beginners. Finally, some courses require you to be fluent in English, while others do not. Be sure you meet any requirements for the course before you enroll. Most babysitting courses are geared toward younger people (often ages 11-17). If you are an adult looking to train in babysitting, search for \"advanced\" courses.\n4. Pay the fee. Various courses will have various fees. Some online babysitting classes are as low as $20, and may go as high as $200. Select a course that you feel good about, and pay the appropriate fee at the time of registration.\n5. Take the course. Once you have registered and paid the fee, you simply need to log in and complete the course. Various courses will span different timelines. Most courses can run anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. In general, the benefit of these online courses is that they may be completed at your own pace. Most courses combine learning modules with short quizzes and tests. Once you have passed the course, you will be able to print out a certificate.\n\n\n## Become a \u201clicensed childcare provider\u201d in your state\n\n1. Decide if you want a career in childcare. Becoming a state licensed childcare provider is more than just \u201cbabysitting.\u201d It means that you are a small business owner responsible for the health, happiness, and development of small children. Before seeking a childcare license, ask yourself the following questions:\n\t* Do I enjoy working with children? Am I knowledgeable about child development or willing to learn? Am I ready to be a small business owner? Do I have the resources I need to start my own childcare business?\n2. Contact the proper department in your state. In each state, there is a department that handles the licensing of childcare providers. Each state will have different specific requirements for gaining your childcare license (such as age and education requirements), so it is important to contact your state before you take any steps. Ask the department for a childcare business application and review the application to ensure you, your intended program, and your property meet the requirements. In Illinois, this is either the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), or the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). In California, this is the Department of Social Services (CDSS). In Missouri, this is the Department of Health and Senior Services. In Florida, child care licenses are issued by the Department of Children and Families (DCF).\n3. Pass background checks. Once you are sure that you meet the age and education requirements in your state, you will need to pass a criminal background check through your state agency. They will also ensure that you do not appear on the national or state\u2013level sex offender registries or within the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System. Each state is different, but you may be disqualified if you have been convicted of a felony. You will likewise be disqualified if you have been convicted of a sex crime, are listed in any sex offender registry, or have been convicted of child abuse or neglect. Additionally, they may look into your driving record and general criminal history.\n4. Pass an inspection. The next step in becoming a licensed childcare provider in your state is for the location to pass an inspection. Whether you plan to open a daycare center or to care for children in your home, an inspector will need to come out and ensure that you meet all the standard health and safety requirements. Once again, these will vary by state, so it is imperative for you to check with your local government agency. Contact your local agency to procure a list of safety requirements, and make any adjustments, before requesting an inspection. For example, some states require you to have a fence around a swimming pool.\n5. Apply for a license through your state. After you have met the age and education requirements, passed the appropriate background checks, and passed the home\/facility inspection, you are eligible to apply for a license in your state. Once again, you will need to contact the appropriate department in your given state and follow the particulars of your state\u2019s procedures.\n","primary_tag":"Information

You can get a copy of this notice by sending a request to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) department. However, you might want a copy of the Form I-140 petition itself. In this situation, you will need to make a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to USCIS.\n\n## Request a copy of your approval notice\n\n1. Download Form I-824. This is the form you need to fill out to get a copy of your Form I-797 Notice of Action. The form is available for download from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. You should download it in PDF format and also get a copy of the instructions. You can also request a form by calling 1-800-375-5283. You cannot use this form if your approval notice has expired or been revoked.\n2. Get a copy of the original petition or application. If available, send a copy of the original I-140 petition. If you don\u2019t have a copy, then ask your employer to provide you with one. However, if you don\u2019t have it, then you don\u2019t need to include it.\n3. Make a copy of your Form I-797. If you have your Form I-797 (but want an additional copy), then send a copy along with your application. You need to submit both the front and the back. If you don\u2019t have the Form I-797, then you don\u2019t need to send it.\n4. Complete Form I-824. You can complete the form in PDF format. Type in the requested information. Answer all questions and type \u201cN\/A\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d to anything that applies. The form will ask for the following information:\n\t* your reason for the request: check \u201cA duplicate approval notice\u201d\n\t* name\n\t* date of birth\n\t* country of birth\n\t* identifying information, such as Alien Registration Number, Social Security Number, IRS Tax Number, etc. mailing address\n\t* physical address\n5. Pay a fee. You have to pay a $405 filing fee. Make your check or money order payable to \u201cU.S. Department of Homeland Security.\u201d Don\u2019t use abbreviations like \u201cDHS\u201d or \u201cUSDHS.\u201d\n\t* Fees are subject to change. You should call 1-800-375-5283 for updated fee information.\n6. Submit your application to the appropriate address. Make a copy of your complete application for your records. Then put your application in a secure envelope and mail it to the appropriate address. You can get the appropriate address by calling the National Customer Service Center at 1-800-375-5283. USCIS might contact you for more information. Please provide requested information promptly.\n\n\n## Obtain a copy of the form i-140 petition\n\n1. Ask your employer for a copy. Your employer files a Form I-140 petition when they want to sponsor you as an immigrant worker. Filing the form is necessary so that you can become a legal permanent resident in the U.S. and work here. Because your employer submitted this petition, you should ask them for a copy. Sometimes, however, your employer won\u2019t give you a copy of the petition. In this situation, you will need to file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Only submit an FOIA request if the petition has been approved. You cannot request a copy of a petition that is under consideration. Instead, call 1-800-375-5283 for inquiries about the status of your application. You can also call the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office where the petition was filed.\n2. Download Form G-639. This is the Freedom of Information Act request form. You should download the form and its instructions. You can also get a copy of the form by calling 1-800-375-5283. You don\u2019t have to use the form. However, all requests must be in writing, and using the form is probably easiest.\n3. Complete the form. Provide requested information by using a typewriter or writing clearly in black ink. If you need extra space to answer a question, then you can attach a sheet of paper. Make sure to put your name and Alien Registration Number (if applicable) at the top of each sheet. Also clearly identify the page number, part, and item number your additional information refers to. If a question doesn\u2019t apply to you, then write \u201cN\/A\u201d or \u201cnot applicable\u201d in the space. Don\u2019t just leave it blank. Make a copy of the form for your records.\n4. Verify your identity. You will need to sign the form under penalty of perjury or in front of a notary public. You can find notaries in courthouses, town offices, and most large banks. Take acceptable forms of identification (such as a valid state-issued ID or passport) with you to the notary. If you are requesting a copy of someone else\u2019s Form I-140, then you must get his or her permission. Typically, getting them to sign this form is sufficient.\n5. Explain why you need the request expedited. Generally, it can take USCIS a month to process your request. However, you can request that USCIS speed up the process if you have a valid reason. For example, you might be in removal proceedings. If you are, then you should make a copy of your Notice to Appear or Notice of Hearing. You will need to submit these documents with your FOIA request. Also write a letter explaining in detail why you urgently need the information. You need to sign the letter under penalty of perjury. Include the following words above your signature: \u201cThe information contained in this letter is complete, true, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d\n6. Pay a fee, if required. You typically won\u2019t have to pay a fee. You get the first 100 pages (and 2 hours of search time) free. Because your Form I-140 is not 100 pages, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything. However, you might have to pay a fee if you order in bulk. For example, you might be an employer getting copies of your employees\u2019 forms. In this situation, you have to pay ten cents per page. You won\u2019t be billed until you have accrued at least $14 in charges. By submitting the form, you agree to pay at least $25 in fees.\n7. Submit your request. Gather all of your documents and make a copy for your own records. You can submit your request using one of these three different methods:\n\t* Fax: send it to (816) 350-5785. Email: send the completed form and supporting documents as attachments to uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov. Mail: send your request certified mail, return receipt requested to National Records Center (NRC), FOIA\/PA Office, PO Box 648010, Lee\u2019s Summit, MO 64064-8010.\n8. Provide additional information. USCIS might contact you and request additional information in order to process your request. You should provide all requested information promptly to USCIS.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"A Form I-140 petition can be

{"instruction":"How to peacefully feed cats in multi\u2010cat households?","response":"## Feed multiple cat at once\n\n1. Feed discrete meals. Feeding all of your cats at one time, instead of letting them graze, will minimize conflict and fighting. Instead of allowing access to food at all times, which can lead to conflict when two cats want to eat from the same bowl at the same time, timed meals will allow all cats to have their own space and food to focus on. How often you feed your cats each day depends on your schedule. In many cases, it works best to feed your cats once in the morning before you leave and once again in the evening when you return. Provide food puzzles if you have a cat(s) that is used to grazing instead of eating at meal times. This will help them transition to timed meals. Putting a small amount of kibble in one of these puzzles won't replace a whole meal but it may satiate a cat enough until meal time comes around.\n2. Monitor feeding time. Do not feed your cats and then leave your home. It is important that you monitor feeding time, so that you can make the cats stay at their own feeding stations and break up any conflicts that might occur. It may be that your presence calms your cats while they eat because they know that they will be protected from other cats trying to get their food when you are around. This will allow them to focus on their food more than on defensiveness. If you see a cat trying to eat another cat's food, physically separate them. It's important that you do this so the more submissive cat doesn't get taken advantage of.\n3. Remove food dishes after 20-30 minutes. When feeding multiple cats you should remove food dishes after the cats have eaten or after 20-30 minutes, if one or more of your cats are very slow about eating. This will teach the cats that there is a set time to eat and if they don't eat at that given time, then there is no food to be had. The goal is to make meal time a time for strictly for eating, not a time to play games, show dominance, or fight for territory. Setting specific meal times and taking away food when meal time is over requires a gradual training process that may take some time for your cats to adjust to. If your cat meows repeatedly at you for food when it is not meal time, just remember that you are working to make a peaceful household and your cat will not starve if it has to wait an hour for food.\n4. Use calming sprays. If your cats are very territorial and tend to fight over food, you may want to try using a calming product made for cats during feeding times. These products tend to be non-toxic sprays that use pheromones to calm cats and reduce fear and aggression. Spray one of these products, which are usually available at most pet stores, around the feeding area or on the specific cats that are most fearful or aggressive. The pheromone sprays used for calming cats mimic the pheromones given off by mother cats to calm their kittens.\n\n\n## Set up separate feed station\n\n1. Give each cat its own dish. When feeding multiple cats, competition can be fierce if every cat doesn't have its own dish to eat from. Separate dishes allow each cat to have their own space and their own food to focus on, instead of focusing on defending against another cat. Make sure that the food bowls are as identical as possible. You do not want to create competition for a food dish that is easier to eat out of or is slightly bigger. Don't forget to place a water bowl near each food bowl. In most cases, when you first set out multiple food dishes the cats will naturally gravitate to one of their own. Once they have basically picked their bowls, make them stick to them to establish their territories.\n2. Don't place food dishes against walls. In many cases, a cat in a multi-cat household will want to be in a position while eating where it can see any other cats coming towards it. If you place food dishes against a wall, the cat will naturally be forced to have its back to the wall. This may add to its anxiety and not allow it to relax during eating. Placing your cat's bowl even a foot away from the wall should allow it to sit in any place around the bowl that it feels is best.\n3. Place the cats as far away from each other as possible. When feeding cats in a multiple cat household, you need to space them away from each other. This may mean that you place food dishes in separate corners of the same room or you place feeding stations in completely separate rooms. Giving all your cats space from other cats will allow them to better focus on their food instead of turf wars or food competition. It is ideal if your cats cannot see each other during meal time. This add tremendously to your cat's ability to focus on food instead of the other cats.\n4. Isolate cats eating different foods. If your cats eat different food, it is important that you feed them in different spaces. This will help you to keep each cat eating the food that it is supposed to eat and it will prevent fights over whatever food your cats consider the tastiest. It may be that one of your cats eats different food and your other cats eat the same food. If this is the case, only the cat with different food needs to be isolated during meal time. Cats that are eating different food need to be kept separate until all cats in the household are done eating. The will remove the temptation to sneak a bite from the bowl of the last cat eating.\n5. Try adding an extra feeding dish if problems persist. Adding 1 more dish than the number of cats you have can help eliminate any chances of conflict. With an extra bowl, your cats won't have a problem finding somewhere to eat in peace. For example, if you have 2 cats, you could try adding a third feeding dish. If you add an additional feeding dish, make sure you put a water dish nearby.\n\n\n## Avoid conflict\n\n1. Coax cats to their own bowls. If more than one cat goes to one bowl at mealtime, you should coax the cat away who does not normally eat at that bowl. This could be done by picking the cat up, calling to it, or luring it towards its own bowl with a bit of food. This separation will prevent territorial disputes and conflict during meal time. There can be power dynamics between cats that they need to sort out themselves. When cats are initially establishing whose dish is whose, there may be some switching up that occurs.\n2. Stop fights right away. When fights break out over territory or food you should break them up right away. Fighting over food, especially between cats who usually get along, can lead to unhealthy aggression, so it should be stopped before it gets serious. If you have two cats that repeatedly fight over food dishes, these cats should be fed in different rooms.\n3. Avoid conflict before it starts. In order to have a peaceful household with multiple cats, you may need to resort to keeping certain cats away from each other most of the time, which includes meal time. This will allow you to avoid conflict before it begins and it allows both cats to have peaceful and calm time in their homes. If you have a very small home, this can be difficult to achieve. Keeping cats that don't get along separated works better if you have a large house or at least several rooms that can be closed off. You can also try feeding aggressive cats in cat carriers. That way they won't be able to run around and harass your other cats when they're finished eating. While it is true that some cats may have conflict at first and then learn to get along, that is not always the case. If you have tried to get your cats to get along and nothing seems to work, it may be time to give them separate territories in your home.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to walk a slackline?","response":"## The basics\n\n1. Start with a short slackline. The shorter the distance between the two anchor points, the more stable the slackline. As the slackline gets longer, a few things happen:\n\t* The tension in the line increases, making dismounts more dangerous due to the extra force;\n\t* The height of the line off the ground increases to allow for greater sag when weighted;\n\t* It requires more force to tighten it, which can be difficult with some tightening systems.\n2. Place one foot lengthwise in the middle of the slackline. Starting barefoot is a good idea. Using bare feet will allow you to feel the line better and find your balance more quickly. Step on the line so that it runs from between your big toe and second toe back to the middle of the heel. As you improve, practice turning your feet and standing sideways, with your shoulders parallel to the line. Once you improve (or if the landing is not safe for bare feet), you may want to switch to shoes since they provide greater protection when attempting tricks and landing.\n3. You can mount the slackline at any point, but starting in the middle is generally safer, since it is usually away from obstacles you might hit when falling. The line is also lower to the ground in the middle once weighted, reducing the height of the falls. Practice from the same place each time since the slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors. The wobbles are faster and smaller near the anchors and slower and larger near the middle. But wherever you start, it is going to wobble a lot. This is natural; everyone wobbles the first time.\n4. Take a couple deep breaths and settle yourself. If you are relaxed, your foot will be less shaky on the line.\n5. Focus intently on a single point, such as the anchor. This will help you find and keep your balance. Resist the temptation to look straight down at your feet on the line. Looking down at the wobbling line will simply make you wobble as well. Look ahead instead of down at the line.\n6. Put your arms out wide, slightly bent and keep an upright posture.\n7. Center your weight directly over the foot on the line. With one smooth, balanced motion stand up on that leg.\n8. Balance on one foot, while using your arms and other leg to help maintain your balance.\n9. Bend the leg that is on the slackline. Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly, and allows you to more easily find your balance and absorb the movements of the line.\n10. Continue to wave your free arms and legs around to help you balance. Sometimes you will twist and turn your body into all sorts of positions to keep your balance. Once you have caught your balance slowly move your body back to center with your arms up and out, knee(s) bent, head up, and eyes focused on a single point.\n11. Repeat these steps until you can balance for at least 15 seconds.\n12. Practice with the other foot. Once you can keep your balance, attempt taking a step.\n13. Once you've successfully taken your first step, keep practicing!\n\n\n## Sample skill progression for beginners\n\n1. These are small steps you can take to improve your slack lining effectively, by slowly taking on harder and harder tasks. Mount the line on one foot with a friend sitting on the line. Increase the distance between you and the person sitting on the line. Balance on one foot by yourself. Balance on the other foot. Balance with both feet, one behind the other, on the line. Take small steps forward. Take small steps backwards. Mount the line sideways (shoulders parallel to the line) with both feet, one at a time. Turn on the line.\n2. Additionally, learn how to fall safely. As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet. As you try new tricks, the slackline can \"throw\" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the \"throw\" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet. If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.\n3. You can also try starting with \"training wheels.\" One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble. When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand\/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need training wheels any more!\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The tension in the line increases.","max_prob":5.9523668289,"ccp":-0.0540379437},{"claim":"Dismounts become more dangerous due to the extra force.","max_prob":38.5563087463,"ccp":-0.0486917904},{"claim":"The height of the line off the ground increases.","max_prob":12.5199680328,"ccp":-0.0235818191},{"claim":"The increased height allows for greater sag when weighted.","max_prob":43.6192016602,"ccp":-0.005871242},{"claim":"It requires more force to tighten the line.","max_prob":22.6680679321,"ccp":-0.0915747133},{"claim":"Tightening the line can be difficult with some tightening systems.","max_prob":40.7487945557,"ccp":-0.1001749905},{"claim":"Using bare feet allows you to feel the line better.","max_prob":10.2338104248,"ccp":-0.0221720147},{"claim":"Using bare feet allows you to find your balance more quickly.","max_prob":13.4646396637,"ccp":-0.0197696636},{"claim":"You may want to switch to shoes if you improve.","max_prob":15.5711202621,"ccp":-0.7699674646},{"claim":"You may want to switch to shoes if the landing is not safe for bare feet.","max_prob":36.332901001,"ccp":-0.0000011442},{"claim":"Shoes provide greater protection when attempting tricks.","max_prob":19.8253211975,"ccp":-0.3191154651},{"claim":"Shoes provide greater protection when landing.","max_prob":11.0685005188,"ccp":-0.2970202687},{"claim":"You can mount the slackline at any point.","max_prob":21.0667228699,"ccp":-0.0235309494},{"claim":"Starting in the middle of the slackline is generally safer.","max_prob":11.1985330582,"ccp":-0.9909867922},{"claim":"The middle of the slackline is usually away from obstacles.","max_prob":16.9684791565,"ccp":-0.0239844104},{"claim":"You might hit obstacles when falling.","max_prob":15.7978010178,"ccp":-0.1530347436},{"claim":"The line is lower to the ground in the middle once weighted.","max_prob":29.9865703583,"ccp":-0.1310434657},{"claim":"The lowering of the line reduces the height of the falls.","max_prob":20.9427814484,"ccp":-0.0068292214},{"claim":"Practicing from the same place each time is recommended.","max_prob":14.7624664307,"ccp":-0.0210368836},{"claim":"The slackline oscillates differently at different distances from the anchors.","max_prob":26.3488483429,"ccp":-0.3537577133},{"claim":"The wobbles are faster near the anchors.","max_prob":19.394536972,"ccp":-0.0006290227},{"claim":"The wobbles are smaller near the anchors.","max_prob":17.4206733704,"ccp":-0.0012275352},{"claim":"The wobbles are slower near the middle.","max_prob":15.9238147736,"ccp":-0.0040233109},{"claim":"The wobbles are larger near the middle.","max_prob":15.5389328003,"ccp":-0.004469119},{"claim":"Bending your leg lowers your center of gravity slightly.","max_prob":11.9212198257,"ccp":-0.9193665538},{"claim":"Bending your leg allows you to more easily find your balance.","max_prob":12.4545125961,"ccp":-0.9757127905},{"claim":"Bending your leg allows you to absorb the movements of the line.","max_prob":17.0989341736,"ccp":-0.6361601753},{"claim":"You have caught your balance.","max_prob":8.7999982834,"ccp":-0.9892219747},{"claim":"You slowly move your body back to center.","max_prob":22.1744689941,"ccp":-0.6020046774},{"claim":"Your arms are up and out.","max_prob":9.2650852203,"ccp":-0.556728063},{"claim":"Your knee(s) are bent.","max_prob":16.3744926453,"ccp":-0.0011027854},{"claim":"Your head is up.","max_prob":4.8363704681,"ccp":-0.1948433336},{"claim":"Your eyes are focused on a single point.","max_prob":6.3994007111,"ccp":-0.3612987889},{"claim":"You are a beginner.","max_prob":3.2776250839,"ccp":-0.8390944721},{"claim":"You will likely be on a slackline.","max_prob":14.7848291397,"ccp":-0.1356623672},{"claim":"The slackline is short.","max_prob":4.973069191,"ccp":-0.3712778621},{"claim":"The slackline is low to the ground.","max_prob":5.3843445778,"ccp":-0.9195654499},{"claim":"You can try new tricks on a slackline.","max_prob":10.7128591537,"ccp":-0.1798602743},{"claim":"The slackline can \"throw\" you.","max_prob":13.0884923935,"ccp":-0.067458514},{"claim":"You can lose your balance on a slackline.","max_prob":5.8889312744,"ccp":-0.0620420505},{"claim":"When starting out, you can aid each other.","max_prob":26.8726119995,"ccp":-0.8678586764},{"claim":"You can learn to balance.","max_prob":7.4507961273,"ccp":-0.3892105942},{"claim":"A spotter can stand next to the line.","max_prob":14.738825798,"ccp":-0.6265920269},{"claim":"A spotter can walk next to the line.","max_prob":21.5966320038,"ccp":-0.8401300367}]}
{"instruction":"How to open your locker?","response":"If there are lockers with locks at your school, you'll probably want to get used to opening yours quickly. Don't worry; it gets easier with practice. See Step 1 to begin learning how to open 99% of all standard school lockers.\n\n## Open when you know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Spin the dial at least three times to the right (clockwise), all the way around. This \"clears\" the lock of any previous numbers. If at any point in putting in your combination you mess up, do this again to start over.\n2. Enter your combination. Turn the dial to the right and stop at your first number. Always start with a turn to the right! For your second number, turn the dial to the left, going past zero and your first number. Then stop at your second number. Some locks are a bit odd or finicky -- if your locker isn't opening after you put the three numbers in correctly, try turning left past your second number once and stopping on it on the next go around. For your third number, turn the dial to the right and go directly to the last number. Leave your lock on this number. Always remember: right, left, right.\n3. Open the lock. Pull the lock open and out of the hole, or pull the latch or handle, if there is one. Otherwise, tug on the knob to open the locker. If your locker just won't open, try it again with the last number being five before or after your \"official\" last number. Sometimes the older locks get, the shakier they get in their requirements or abilities. If that doesn't work, ask your classmates or teacher if there are any similar quirks in the school locker system. Try twice before you call a teacher.\n4. Lock your locker after use. Make sure, if you have a locker with an unattached lock, that you lock your locker when you leave. If you don't, it's possible your things will get stolen or your lock will be turned backwards. Close your lock up and twist the dial a bit. If you leave it on the final number, it may open up again effortlessly, for someone other than you.\n\n\n## Open when you don't know your padlock's combination\n\n1. Apply pressure upward. This means taking your finger and wrapping it around the latch. It should pull up just a teeny bit when it's locked. While you're doing this, rotate the lock counterclockwise until it locks. You may have to apply a bit of strength to do this, but it won't break it.\n2. Write down the numbers it locks at. Repeat this action 11 more times. Seven of the numbers you get will be between two digits; ignore those. Continue with the 5 outliers. Of those 5, 1 should not end in the same digit. That's your third number. Obviously, it's very important to know exactly where the lock stops at. Be diligent and take a keen eye to your lock.\n3. Use trial and error. You're now down to just 100 possible combinations -- that's 15 minutes' work. Your third number actually allows you to eliminate possible first and second numbers, believe it or not. It may take a bit, but it will open with perseverance. If your third number is 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, or 36:\n\t* Your first number is either 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 28, 32, or 36. Your second number is either 0, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, or 38. If your third number is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, or 37:\n\t* Your first number is either 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, or 37.

{"instruction":"How to increase driving visibility in rain?","response":"Driving in the rain, especially after dark, can cause dramatic declines in visibility.  The best ways to improve driving visibility in the rain are to turn on your headlights and your windshield wipers.  Stay away from large vehicles that leave a large spray in their wake.  Keep your headlights clean and clear, and change windshield wipers that are aged or deteriorating.\n\n## Use and maintain your wipers\n\n1. Turn your windshield wipers on. Unless your car comes with automatic wipers, you\u2019ll need to manually activate your windshield wipers to improve driving visibility in the rain. Windshield wipers typically have three different settings: slow, medium, and fast. If the rain is light, select the slow speed. If the rain is heavier (and your visibility is poorer), select a faster speed. If you wish, you could use the high speed in low levels of rain, but it is not necessary. There is no objective criteria for determining whether you need a faster or slower wiper speed when driving in the rain. Using your best judgment, select the wiper speed that most closely corresponds to the rain\u2019s intensity at any given time. If you have a rear windshield wiper, activate it, too.\n2. Change old or brittle wiper inserts. The windshield wiper consists of two parts: the rubber wiper insert that swipes across the windshield and the metal blade that actually holds it. Check your wiper inserts regularly for stiffness or cracks, and replace them if you detect any. Most windshield wiper inserts will need to be changed at least once every three years to improve visibility in rain. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or an auto parts store for information regarding the type and size of wiper blades you need. Generally, wiper inserts can simply be slid into and out of the metal blade itself. If you regularly park your car outside, you\u2019ll probably have to replace your windshield wipers more often than if you park in the garage.\n3. Replace windshield wiper blades as needed. If your wiper blades are rusty, bent, or corroded, replace them, too. Use high-quality wiper blades, preferably ones coated with a rain repellent. If there are areas of your windshield that do not get properly wiped when you use your wipers, you\u2019ll know that the wiper is bent or applying uneven pressure to the windshield. Generally, wiper blades can simply be unsnapped from the metal arm that holds the blade, then a new blade can be snapped in. Consult your owner\u2019s manual or your local auto parts store for information regarding the sort of wiper blades you need.\n4. Keep your wiper blades clean. Dirty windshield wiper blades can cause streaking and water beading. To clean your wiper blades, soak a lint-free cloth or paper towel in windshield washer fluid. Wipe the cloth or paper towel along the length of the blades. Turn the cloth or paper towel over as needed to ensure you\u2019re always wiping the blades with a clean area.\n\n\n## Use and clean your headlights\n\n1. Turn on your headlights. If you\u2019re driving in the rain on an overcast day or at night, your headlights can help you increase visibility. Even if you\u2019re driving in rain during the day, turning your headlights on is a good idea since it allows other vehicles to see you. Many headlights have different settings. Choose the correct one for the existing conditions. For instance, if you\u2019re driving in light rain through a dark area, you might choose to use your brightest headlight setting. If you\u2019re driving through fog as well as rain, use your fog lights.\n2. Wash your headlights. If your headlights are caked in grime or dirt, they will not shine as brightly as they should. This could reduce your visibility when driving in the rain. To keep your headlights shining properly, wash them with soapy water either on their own or when you wash your car. There is no regular schedule according to which you must wash your headlights. If your headlights appear less luminous than they previously were, or if they\u2019re visibly dirty, give them a wash.\n3. Scrub your headlights with sandpaper. For a deeper clean, soak a piece of 1000 grit wet\/dry sandpaper in cold water. Apply painter\u2019s tape to the area of around the perimeter of your headlights. After 10 minutes, lightly sand the headlights, moving in straight strokes from side-to-side. Spray the headlight with water while you work. Repeat the procedure using 1500 grit sandpaper, then 2000 grit, 2500 grit, and 3000 grit wet\/dry sandpaper. Alternate the direction of your scrubbing each time. For instance, if you moved side-to-side with one piece of sandpaper, use an up-and-down scrubbing method for the next. When the discoloration, dirt, and scratches on the headlight are gone, move on to the next level of sandpaper. There is no regular schedule according to which you must engage in deep cleaning of your headlights. Give your headlights a deep cleaning with sandpaper if washing your headlights using the standard method produces inadequate results.\n\n\n## Take additional measure\n\n1. Don\u2019t follow trucks or buses closely. The spray produced by these large vehicles will decrease your visibility in rain. Try to keep several car lengths away from trucks and buses. If you need to pass trucks or buses, do so quickly so as to minimize the time you spend behind or beside them, where you can experience significant spray.\n2. Put on some polarized glasses. If you\u2019re driving through rain during the day, put on a pair of polarized sunglasses to increase your driving visibility. If you\u2019re driving in rain at night, you will not be able to increase driving visibility by wearing polarized sunglasses.\n3. Turn on the demisters if necessary. If the temperature of the rain and the temperature inside your vehicle are too different, your windows might fog over. To combat this and increase visibility when driving in the rain, turn on the demisters.\n4. Slow down. Slowing your speed can give you extra time to see what\u2019s ahead. You should be able to see the space you\u2019ll be driving through at least 12 seconds before you pass through it. When driving in the rain, adjust your speed to meet this visibility standard.\n5. Clean your windshield. Sometimes your windshield wipers are not strong enough to wipe away all the grime on your windshield. Dirt stuck to the top corners, especially, could dribble down during a rainstorm. The best way to get your windshield clean is to have it cleaned by a professional at your local auto wash. Alternately, you could soak a cloth or sponge in soapy water and wipe it across the windshield until the entire surface is clean. Clean your windshield when it is dirty. Don\u2019t forget to clean your windshield wiper blades, too.\n6. Apply a coat of rain repellent to your windshield. Rain repellents will prevent rain from beading on your windshield. Instead, rain will roll smoothly off the windshield upon contact. Specific directions for use vary depending on the product you use. Generally, though, you can simply spray the repellent of your choice on the windshield, then wipe it away using a gentle circular motion. Rain repellent solutions usually need to be applied once every six months.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to repair your damaged reputation at work?","response":"People make mistakes. Sometimes these mistakes are bad enough to cost us the respect of those around us or even our jobs. If you\u2019ve made a bad professional error or hurt colleagues at work, though, the damage might not be permanent. You can put the past behind you, but you\u2019ll have to work hard to rebuild relationships, become a model worker, and, in some cases, manage your reputation online.\n\n## Rebuild relationships\n\n1. Admit your mistake. If you\u2019ve damaged your reputation \u2013 wronging a coworker, angering your boss, or just getting an overall bad name \u2013 the place to start is to own up to it. Admit the error of your ways. Take stock of your actions and accept responsibility for them, to yourself and in front of others. What happened? Where did you go wrong? Be brutally honest with yourself. For example, do you have bad personal habits? Did you try to cut corners and dodge work? Have you been an office gossip? Or, did you have a serious lapse of judgement? Perhaps you stole someone\u2019s idea and got caught or plagiarized a report. Perhaps you just stole, embezzling money.\n2. Apologize. Even if you don\u2019t have a future at your workplace, you should apologize to the people you\u2019ve hurt. Showing remorse is decent and will help you start to redeem yourself. You will not get very far with building bridges and repairing your reputation if you can\u2019t say sorry. Act as soon as you can. The longer you wait to apologize, the more it seems like you aren\u2019t really that sorry. Don\u2019t make excuses. The point is to show remorse and accept that you were wrong. Don\u2019t insert half-excuses or mealy-mouth language into your apology, for example \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you were offended that I took your idea. I only wanted to improve it.\u201d\n\t* Be humble and own up. For instance, \u201cIt was really wrong of me to talk behind your back. I know I\u2019ve hurt you and want to ask for your forgiveness.\u201d\n\t* Be sincere. You won\u2019t get credit if you don\u2019t say specifically what you did. You also won\u2019t credit if you don\u2019t say it apologetically and sincerely, showing that you won't repeat the behavior.\n3. Commit to reform. Besides an apology, write out a plan for how you\u2019ll change and ensure your mistake doesn\u2019t happen again. This can be for you alone or, if you\u2019re lucky to keep your job, to share with the powers that be in the organization. Outline what you did wrong and how you will avoid it. For example, \u201cI made the mistake of getting too involved in workplace gossip and ended up saying harmful things about my coworkers. From now on, I plan to keep my head down, mind my own business, and avoid office politics.\u201d\n\t* Don\u2019t forget to \u201cwalk the walk\u201d and follow your plan. You might arrange regular check-ins with your boss, for instance, to discuss your behavior. This will highlight your progress as well as show that you are willing and able to reform.\n4. Keep your attitude in check. Repairing your reputation is going to be a humbling experience. You might feel angry or resentful. You might get annoyed, frustrated, or upset. Keep these emotions under control \u2013 you\u2019ve had a bad attitude in the past and need others to see that you\u2019re trying to change. Try to stay calm, collected, and positive. Be aware of the attitudes or emotions that added to your bad behavior in the past. Try to avoid them or situations that bring them out. If your problem is gossip, avoid the office gossipers as best you can. Stop and ask yourself throughout the day, \u201cHow\u2019s my attitude? Am I positive? Am I productive?\u201d Catch any problems early and try to readjust your mindset.\n\n\n## Become a model employee\n\n1. Get to work early. Apart from apologies and repairing relationships, set yourself up as a model employee to help you rebuild your work reputation. Be a go-getter. Arrive early and ready to impress. People will eventually start to notice. Getting to work early will make a good impression on your boss and perhaps your coworkers. Often, people aren\u2019t around to see who leaves the office last. But they will notice your presence in the morning. Being early also means you don\u2019t have to rush around. Use the quiet time to your advantage and plan out your day. It doesn\u2019t hurt to take a short walk around the office first thing in the morning. People will see you and take note.\n2. Prioritize. Some people have trouble keeping track of what they need to do during a given day or week. Take initiative and prioritize your work. Keep your nose to the grindstone to avoid returning to past mistakes and to present yourself as great employee. For instance, sit down and write out what you need to do for each day or, longer term, each week and month. If you\u2019ve been coming to work early, use that time to set out daily priorities. Having a to-do list will help you focus your energy. You might also tailor the list to take advantage of your peak work hours. For instance, if you do your best work in the morning, save that time for your top priorities. Try to stick to the list. That said, be flexible in case your boss gives you special instructions.\n3. Do your tasks thoroughly and on-time. Writing down your tasks isn\u2019t all, of course. You actually need to follow through and do them well. Good work and dependability can make a past mistake fade over time. Build up a track record for reliability and your colleagues and boss will have more trust in you in the future. Meet your deadlines. What about that report that\u2019s due next week? Prioritize it in your list on Monday. If you still can\u2019t get it done during the week, consider finishing it at home or over the weekend rather than asking for more time. Be productive, especially if you have had consistency problems before. Take a short breather to stretch or use the restroom, but don\u2019t try to skirt work.\n4. Go above and beyond. Handing in finished work on time is good. To be a model employee, though, you will have to aim even higher and win (or win back) your boss\u2019 trust. Track details, anticipate tasks, and work ahead to further develop a good reputation. If a colleague asks you to think of venues for an upcoming tradeshow, for example, don\u2019t just stop at a list. Take the next steps: call them, ask about availability, and compare prices. When you take initiative like this, you\u2019ll seem smart and like the logical go-to person for key projects.\n\n\n## Repair your reputation online\n\n1. Check your online metrics. If your error was very serious, or if you are well-known and hold a big position, you might want to think about your online presence when rebuilding your reputation. Don\u2019t underestimate negative online info. To start, you will need to take stock of the situation. You can get a quick sense of your online reputation by checking Google\u2019s autocomplete. Just go to the Google homepage. What appears when you type in your name, or your company name? When you enter your name, for example, do you get something positive or neutral like \u201cHarold Bing Brew Co. CEO\u201d and \u201cHarold Bing business award\u201d? Or is it damaging, like \u201cHarold Bing mugshot\u201d? Look at online news stories or reviews about you or your company, if applicable. Check local sites or other social media. Set up a Google Alert in your name, so that you\u2019ll be notified any time something new is posted.\n2. Deal with Google defamation. Programs like Google Suggest reflect real internet searches and should give you an idea of how people associate your name and reputation online. Did you find something unwelcome in your results? There are some things you can do. Do not try to manipulate the results. While some people suggest this approach, using techniques like crowdsourcing, you might end up causing more damage. You might try acquiring the search term and building an optimized page to tell your viewpoint. That way, when someone types \u201cJuliette Page embezzler\u201d she is directed to your side of the story \u2013 that the charge is false, misunderstood, or not reported right. You can also request that the search engine take down the autocomplete. This is hard and usually only works with results that suggest hate or violence, porn, or personal information. Still, it may be worthwhile to try.\n3. Hire an online reputation manager. Your online reputation could get out of control. Don\u2019t despair, however. There are people and agencies who can help you manage this kind of situation, like Reputation.com or BrandYourself.com. The work will be pricy, but it may just salvage your working reputation. Reputation managers won\u2019t always be able to get rid of negative content from the web. But they should be able to highlight positives about you. For example, their services might include setting up a domain in your name for a page presenting your side of the story. They can also respond to negative comments or reviews and manage your online presence on sites like Facebook, Twitter, or Youtube. The goal is not to eliminate all negative info about you, but to tip the balance in your favor whenever someone searches for you online. Keep in mind that management services don\u2019t come cheap. Expect to pay between $20 to $200 per month.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Planning,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to buy school supplies?","response":"Shopping for school supplies can be stressful for both the seasoned shopper and the beginner. Working parents or guardians have to fight the crowds that gather on weekends or after the end of the workday. Even worse, the cost of school supplies steadily increases every year, costing families an average of just under $100 in 2015. The good news is that you don\u2019t have to stress out or go bankrupt. By spacing out your purchases and practicing a few money-saving hacks, you can survive the back-to-school madness.\n\n## Buy basic supply\n\n1. Get a list from your child\u2019s school. Don\u2019t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn\u2019t available on the school\u2019s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites.\n2. Know the difference between requests and requirements. Before you panic over the long supply list on the school\u2019s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests. One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.\n3. Purchase writing supplies. Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper. Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art. Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it\u2019s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child\u2019s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners. Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.\n4. Buy folders. Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc. ).\n5. Purchase a day planner. Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.\n6. Buy art supplies. Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.\n7. Purchase personal supplies. Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack. Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.\n8. Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag. Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time. However, textbooks haven\u2019t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.\n\n\n## Shop for electronics\n\n1. Buy a calculator. High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:\n\t* Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30. Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.\n2. Purchase a computer. High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list. Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget.\n3. Buy external storage. Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.\n\n\n## Save money\n\n1. Sort out what you already have. Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn\u2019t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s). Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt. Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.\n2. Stick to basics and generics. Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don\u2019t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs.\n3. Take advantage of discounts. Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back. Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.\n4. Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks. Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.\n5. Buy refurbished. Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues.\n6. Buy a little at a time throughout the year. There\u2019s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you\u2019re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to play sonic unleashed for xbox 360?","response":"Some people may find Sonic Unleashed on the Xbox 360 hard. But it's pretty easy with practice. Some may find it hard to press several buttons quickly.\n\n## Controller basics\n\n1. When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.\n2. The left control stick is used to move Sonic; the A button is used for jumping ; the B button is used to boost; the X button is used to stomp or crouch; the Y button is used for the light speed dash; the trigger buttons are used for drifting; and the bumper buttons are used for side stepping left and right.\n3. Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.\n\n\n## Boost guidelines\n\n1. To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).\n2. When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.\n3. Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.\n\n\n## Attack techniques\n\n1. The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed\/wrongly timed jumps.\n2. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.\n3. Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.\n\n\n## 2d platforming\n\n1. 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.\n2. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.\n3. Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.\n\n\n## Trick\n\n1. There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.\n2. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.\n3. Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.\n4. Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.\n5. Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You are holding the

{"instruction":"How to flirt with a co worker (for women)?","response":"Flirting with coworkers can relieve workplace tension and monotony. Some women flirt because they are interested in starting a romantic relationship with one of their coworkers. Others do it just for fun. Workplace flirting requires extra precautions because you must remain professional. You can still encourage some playful interaction between you and your coworker by engaging in friendly conversation, adjusting your body language, and dressing in a flirtatious but professional way.\n\n## Interact with your coworker\n\n1. Chat with them. Men tend to interpret friendly and talkative women as flirty. Find excuses to chat with them when they are not busy. Some things you can try:\n\t* Talk about hobbies, interests, and plans outside of work. \"Any big plans for the weekend? I've been dying to see this new movie myself.\" Praise their recent accomplishments or awards: \"I heard you just received an award! Any plans to celebrate?\" Ask them about current projects by saying, \"Hey, how is that current project going? Are you hanging in there?\"\n2. Laugh at their jokes. If your coworker makes a joke or says something even slightly funny, laugh. Laughing is a gentle way of flirting. It should not feel forced, nor should it seem as though you are laughing at your coworker.\n3. Compliment them. Appreciate the work that they do around the office, and praise them for their strengths. You want to make sure that you are appreciating their skills, abilities, and personality instead of their looks. Some good, flirty compliments include:\n\t* \"Great job on that last presentation. You'll have to give me some tips.\" \"Thanks for helping with that last project. You make my life so much easier around here.\" \"You have such good ideas. How do you come up with them?\" Be extremely careful with workplace compliments. If it seems as though the recipient is awkward or uncomfortable, stop immediately.\n4. Ask them for help. Asking people to help you can increase their self-esteem and confidence, which encourages them to flirt back with you. It also shows that you appreciate their strengths in a work-friendly manner. It can even encourage them to spend more time with you. Some ways you try this include:\n\t* \"Hey, you're good with technology, right? Can you help me with my computer?\" \"Do you mind listening to me practice my presentation? I'd love to get your feedback on this.\" \"Can you help me lock up tomorrow night?\"\n5. Hang out around their desk. Find excuses to drop by their desk. Perhaps you have a question about your project. Perhaps their desk is close to the coffee maker. As you pass by, make eye contact and ask them about their day. Walk by their desk, and try to catch their eye. If they look up at you, smile and ask, \"how's your day been?\" or \"Are you hanging in there?\" You can also ask, \"how is the work going? Do you want to take a coffee break?\" This gives them the opportunity to start a conversation if they are interested. Do not interrupt your coworker if they look as though they are busy with something else. Instead of being flirty, you might only annoy them.\n6. Invite them out to coffee or lunch. You may be feeling bolder, or you want to make the next step in your relationship. Instead of asking them to drinks or dinner, which can be too formal, try asking them if they would like to grab something to eat over your lunch break. Coffee is also a great way to bond with your coworker. A good way to ask is to just say, \"Hey, we should catch up over lunch. Do you want to grab a bite to eat somewhere?\"\n7. Respect their boundaries. Your first priority at work is to do your job. Be warned that flirting at work can get you in trouble if someone complains. If your coworker seems uncomfortable or asks you to stop, do not continue flirting with them. Give them space by only talking to them about work-related matters for a few weeks. Before you make any moves whatsoever, review your workplace sexual harassment rules, as well as rules about relationships in the workplace. You can also talk to someone in the HR department if you have any further questions. Make workplace friendly jokes that have no sexual innuendo. Never flirt with your boss. They are in a position of power, and any flirting can cause professional difficulties for both of you. It is best to flirt with coworkers on your pay grade. Do not flirt with a coworker who is married or in a relationship. Even if a married coworker enjoys your flirting, you are putting both of you in a difficult situation.\n\n\n## Express interest with body language\n\n1. Make eye contact. Eye contact is one of the primary tactics of flirtation. Brief glances can show your attraction and interest in another person. You can try looking across the room during a meeting or glancing across the table at lunch. Meet their eyes briefly before glancing down and away.\n2. Smile. Smiling is an open and friendly act that invites people to interact with you. In fact, smiling may be one of the best ways to meet new people and start new relationships. As your coworker passes your desk, glance up briefly and smile. If you catch their eye in a meeting, give them a quick grin. Don\u2019t linger. A small smile is all it takes.\n3. Show off your neck. When you know they are looking at you, try to casually flip your hair to show off your neck. This shows the curve of your neck while drawing attention to your hair. This is a casual but flirty move that makes it seem as though you are not deliberately trying to catch their attention.\n4. Lean over their desk. Leaning or orienting yourself towards another person signals that you are interested in them. You can practice this while working on a project with your coworker. Lean over the desk to point out something. Reach out so that your arm is crossing their body without touching them. If you\u2019re working on a shared computer, shift your body so that your feet and shoulders are tilted towards them.\n5. Avoid touching. While gently touching someone is often a form of flirting, it can get you in trouble in the workplace. Try to use body language that does not involve physical contact. If your touching is unwanted, you can get in trouble for harassment.\n\n\n## Increase your attractiveness\n\n1. Wear make-up. Many men find women who wear make-up more appealing. Men typically like to flirt more with women whom they find attractive, so making yourself more attractive is especially important if you want to flirt with a co-worker. Eye make-up in particular can increase your flirtatiousness.\n2. Put on heels. Heels can increase your attractiveness to men. The higher your heels, the more likely men are to approach you. High heels can push your pelvis and chest out, arch your backside, and make your legs look tighter and more muscular\u2014all of which make you more attractive.\n3. Apply light perfume. Perfume can boost your sex appeal but only if it is used sparingly. Spray once on your wrists. Rub your wrists together before dabbing them on your neck. This will give you just enough perfume to attract someone without annoying your other colleagues.\n4. Maintain professional standards. While you should look appealing to your coworker, you must keep in mind that you have to look professional as well. Follow your workplace\u2019s dress code. Avoid tight or short clothing that reveals too much skin. Instead, try to find clothes that fit your body\u2019s shape without being too revealing. If you can, try using eye catching colors instead of revealing clothing. Wear jewelry to draw attention to your neck and arms. Make sure that your hair is brushed and styled in a way that both accentuates your features and provides minimal distraction to you while working.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to treat ocd and anxiety as a workaholic?","response":"Working too much is a serious problem. Often, people who work too much also suffer from OCD or related anxiety disorders. If you work too much and suffer from an anxiety disorder, there are several things you can do to lead a more balanced life. You can start by seeing your doctor and going to therapy. Lifestyle changes, such as adopting stress-relieving techniques, making work boundaries, and managing your anxiety or OCD, are also important.\n\n## Manage your anxiety disorder\n\n1. Make a self-care plan. To improve your relationship with work and alleviate anxiety or OCD symptoms, you can develop a self-care plan that covers every area of your life. If you are obsessed with working, the rest of your life may be neglected. A self-care plan helps you balance your life and pay attention to each part of your life. Your self-care plan can focus on work, relationships, leisure time, the self, and your spiritual life. By breaking down your life into concrete categories, you can see where you are lacking and what needs improvement. For example, you may have 90% of your energy into your work. Your self-care plan allows you to schedule an hour each evening for leisure, where you watch television, an hour of exercise to focus on yourself, and two hours to spend with your family. On the weekends, you spend Saturday with your family and friends, and Sunday you focus on yourself. Start working on balancing your life. All of your energy now is focused on work. You should think about what\u2019s important to you, like family and friend relationships or improving your leisure time. Put more effort into those areas of your life and less into work. Becoming more balanced in your life, improving relationships, and working on yourself can help reduce stress that leads to anxiety and OCD.\n2. Get enough sleep. Many people who work all of the time don\u2019t sleep enough because they are too busy working. This can worsen anxiety and OCD symptoms, making you feel even worse. Worsening anxiety and OCD symptoms may also affect your work quality. To help with this, strive to get into a healthy sleep routine. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night. You should go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning. This helps you adopt healthy sleeping habits.\n3. Take stress-relief breaks during the day. If you are spending all of your time focusing on work, your stress levels may be extremely high. This can increase your anxiety or OCD symptoms. To help alleviate your anxiety, take small breaks from work throughout the day to relieve stress. For example, take a 10 minute walk around the building or block. Exercise can help boost your mood and improve your anxiety. Go to lunch with coworkers or friends. Spending time connecting with people can help reduce anxiety and OCD symptoms.\n4. Engage in stress-relief techniques. When your anxiety or OCD symptoms get too bad because you are not working, you may need to use stress-relieving techniques to alleviate the symptoms. At first, you may even experience anxiety attacks as you fight compulsions or obsessive thoughts about working. Try deep breathing to help relieve anxiety. Whenever you feel overwhelmed by anxiety or OCD symptoms when you aren\u2019t working, take a deep breath through your nose as you count to five. Hold it for a count of five, then exhale through your mouth for a count of five. Regular exercise is a great way to treat anxiety and OCD symptoms. A thirty minute walk each day can reduce your symptoms. Try getting active each day, or try stress-relieving exercises such as yoga or tai chi.\n5. Meditate. One good way to learn how to calm down and let go of work is to meditate. Meditation helps you learn how to clear your mind so you can reduce stress. Mediation is also a good treatment for anxiety and OCD. Mediation helps you get rid of negative thoughts, stress, guilt, and anxiety. Meditation may also help you be able to control compulsions and obsessive thoughts. Guided meditation is a good starting place if you\u2019ve never meditated before. Guided meditation walks you through the process, so you are coached to relaxation and towards your mental goals.\n6. Develop hobbies. When you work too much, you may begin to lose yourself and forget to focus on anything that is enjoyable or enriching in your life. To help work on your sense of self, revisit old hobbies or develop new interests that have nothing to do with work. At first, you may have to tell yourself that spending time not working is okay. Remind yourself, \u201cSpending time engaging in hobbies helps me be a healthier, happier person. I have completed my work and I deserve something good.\u201d\n\n\n## Seek medical treatment\n\n1. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to begin treatment. To get proper treatment for your anxiety disorder or OCD, you need to get a proper diagnosis for both conditions. Anxiety disorders and OCD are serious mental illnesses that should be treated by a doctor or a therapist. If you work too much and you also suffer from anxiety or OCD, then your symptoms may be even more pronounced. However, with proper treatment, you can alleviate your symptoms and live a healthier life. Your doctor may suggest medication to treat the anxiety and OCD symptoms. Psychotherapy is also a common treatment for anxiety disorders. Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist or therapist who can provide therapy to address your anxiety disorder, OCD, and addiction-like behaviors. To find a therapist, start by asking your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area who specialize in your disorder. When you search online, you can also read reviews and patient experiences with the therapist.\n2. Undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. One effective treatment for anxiety and OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns into healthier ones. This can also help change your attitude about work, along with helping you cope with obsessive and anxious thoughts and compulsions. You may have unhealthy or untrue beliefs about work. A therapist can help you work through these beliefs and modify them into healthier, more productive beliefs. For example, if you believe you will lose your job if you don\u2019t work all the time, your therapist can use CBT to help you change that thought to something like, \u201cI can work hard for this many hours each week and keep my job.\u201d\n3. Go to family therapy. Family therapy may be needed if working too much and having anxiety has negatively affected your family relationships. During family relationships, a therapist can help you learn how to interact with your family and make them a priority in your life. Your therapist can also help you figure out activities that you and your family can do together. These activities can strengthen your relationship and help you alter your attention away from work and onto leisure activity and relationships. You and your family can use therapy to learn how to communicate with each other. You may also be able to be truthful about ways your behavior has hurt each other. For example, your partner may say, \"I feel hurt that we never take any vacations because you are always working.\" You might say, \"I am frustrated because you get angry when I check my work e-mail in the evenings.\"\n\n\n## Establish work-related boundaries\n\n1. Leave work at work. When you leave work, you should do just that - leave work behind. Try not to take work home with you. Focusing on work at home can increase your anxiety and OCD symptoms while feeding your need to work. Try to make a clear boundary between work time and time not at work. For example, you can decide not to check your email or answer your phone when you\u2019re at home. Leave all paperwork and projects at work. Don\u2019t bring them home with you. If you must answer emails or work on paperwork at night, set aside a designated half an hour or hour to do just that. This helps keep your work time separate from your home time. It also keeps you from doing work all night.\n2. Talk to your boss about work boundaries. If working too much is triggering your anxiety or OCD, then you may want to talk to your boss about setting boundaries. You should tell our boss that you need to make clear boundaries about when you work and when you won\u2019t work. This may include what you will and won\u2019t do when you\u2019re off the clock. If you are an hourly worker, you may tell your boss that you will only work during your required hours. If your boss wants you to work outside of those hours, you may negotiate overtime or say no. If you are salaried, you may set a limit on the amount of hours you will work and discuss this with your boss. You may want to say, \u201cI have been working too much and spreading myself too thin. I would like to set some boundaries in relation to the hours I work.\u201d\n3. Change your thoughts about work. If you have anxiety and OCD, you may be plagued by inaccurate thoughts or obsessions. You may believe if you don\u2019t work all the time you will lose your job. You may have the compulsion to work constantly and get edgy or irritated if you are unable to work. To help treat your anxiety and OCD symptoms, work on changing your thoughts about work. Start by telling yourself that being away from work doesn\u2019t make you lazy or unproductive. Repeat to yourself, \u201cI do not have to work every hour of every day. I can take time to focus on myself and relationships.\u201d\n\t* Face your obsessive or anxious thoughts. When you start to feel anxious because you aren\u2019t working, tell yourself, \u201cNothing bad will happen if I am not working. These are just my anxieties. I deserve to take a break from work.\u201d\n4. Prioritize your to-do list. Due to your anxiety, you may have a long to-do list with things you must get done. Maybe you have obsessive thoughts about what will happen if you don\u2019t complete everything, or you have the compulsion to keep working until you have completed everything on the list. This is not healthy and just feeds anxiety and stress. Instead, start prioritizing the things you have to do and limiting your to-do list. For example, honestly assess everything on your list. What are things that have to get done today? What things have to be done by the end of the week? What things have no time limit on them? You may have to finish paperwork for work by the end of the day, complete a project by the end of the week, but making fliers can be done when you get to them. Limit your tasks to around five per day. If you have to add something to your task list for that day, you need to remove one task. Keep yourself limited so you don\u2019t overextend yourself.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to help an older dog grieve the loss of its owner?","response":"## Comfort the dog\n\n1. Spend extra time with the dog. A dog in mourning may need extra love and attention. Try to increase the amount of time you spend with the dog. You might spend twenty extra minutes in the morning and evening to help give the dog support while they are grieving the death of their owner. During this time, you can:\n\t* Talk to the dog\n\t* Walk the dog\n\t* \n\t* Groom the dog\n\t* \n\t* Go on a car ride\n\t* Visit the dog park\n\t* Pick out a new toy together at the pet store\n\t* Cuddle the dog on the couch or in bed\n\t* Take the dog for a run, if the dog is healthy enough\n\t* Play a game, like fetch or tug-of-war\n2. Pet the dog. Touch increases the bond between dogs and people. Extra cuddling, petting, and brushing can improve the dog\u2019s mood and distract them from the loss of their owner. As you spend time with the dog, rub their belly or scratch their ears. Give them a little extra grooming time each week. This will help you bond and comfort the dog.\n3. Play their favorite games. Playtime can distract the dog from the loss of their owner. The extra exercise can also boost their mood and decrease the likelihood of grief-related health issues. Try to identify the dog\u2019s favorite games or toys, and spend extra time playing with them. Some older dogs may not want to play as much. Each dog is different. If the dog is uninterested in playing, you might try another way of distracting them. You can also give the dog new and interesting toys. Food puzzle toys can help keep the dog busy while you are not home, reducing the dog\u2019s separation anxiety.\n4. Invite company over. The dog may appreciate having people over to spend time with. Invite a few friends over, and see how the dog reacts. If the dog enjoys the company and socializes with the people, you may want to keep it up. If the dog avoids your guests, you should respect their space. Inviting people or dogs that the dog already knows may cheer the dog up. It can also introduce an element of familiarity in their new life. If the people are total strangers to the dog, invite one or two over at a time to see how well the dog handles it.\n\n\n## Monitor the dog\u2019s health\n\n1. Identify physical symptoms of mourning. Dogs mourn differently from humans. While some dogs may not mourn at all, others will become extremely clingy, anxious, or lethargic. Keep an eye out for the following symptoms. If they do not disappear after a few days, you might consider seeking help from a vet or dog behaviorist. Lethargy or lack of energy. Lack of interest in playing\n\t* Loss of appetite\n\t* \n\t* Unsociable behavior\n\t* Increased sleeping\n\t* \n\t* Weight loss\n\t* Decline in physical health\n2. Encourage the dog to eat. It is very common for older dogs to stop eating after the loss of their owner. This can cause other health issues to develop. If the dog seems to have stopped eating, you should try to get the dog to eat. If possible, keep feeding the dog the same food that the old owner fed them. You can also give the dog kibble in a kong-type dog toy or food puzzle. The dog may enjoy trying to get the food out of the toy. Add a little warm chicken broth to the dog\u2019s dry food to make it softer and more enticing. While a few extra treats here and there may not be detrimental to your dog, you should avoid giving the dog too many treats during this period. They may learn that they will be rewarded for whining, and they may not eat their normal food.\n3. Take the dog on walks. Older dogs may not be extremely active to begin with, but they may become more lethargic after the loss of their owner. Such inactivity can lead to further health problems. If the dog is able, take them on a walk at least once or twice a day. Depending on the age and health of the dog, these may be short walks. You can make even short walks more mentally stimulating for the dog by walking in areas with lots of interesting sights, sounds, and smells. For example, you might take your dog to the park, through the woods, or some place with water.\n4. Take the dog to the vet. If the dog continues to mourn for several weeks or if the dog is not eating, you should visit the vet to make sure that the dog is still in good health. The vet can diagnose an underlying medical problem or prescribe medication to help with the dog's anxiety or depression. While at the vet, you might ask:\n\t* \"What medical issues does this dog have? Can any of them be aggravated by the loss of their owner?\" \"The dog seems really depressed. What can I do to help?\" \"The dog has been sleeping a lot since I took them in. Is this because the dog is depressed or is there another issue?\" \"The dog has not been eating since their owner died. What can I do to encourage them to eat?\" If you know which vet the dog's old owner used, you should take them there. The vet can inform you of the dog's medical history.\n\n\n## Provide a happy home\n\n1. Maintain a routine. For the first few days after the owner has died, it is important to maintain the dog\u2019s routine as much as possible. Older dogs tend not to do well with new habits, schedules, or activities, and the owner\u2019s death may have already disrupted their life. Try to feed and walk the dog at the same times as the old owner did. If you can, reach out to people who knew the dog when it was with the old owner, and see if they have an idea of what the dog\u2019s former routine was like. If you do not know what schedule the old owner kept, you can develop a new schedule for the dog. Keep a consistent routine for the first few weeks that the dog joins you. The dog may also prompt you when they expect to be fed or taken outside. If there has been upheaval in the dog\u2019s life since the owner died (for example, if the dog has been passed around by family members or if you adopted the dog from a shelter), setting a routine will be even more important for the dog. Make sure that you stick to the schedule to help the dog ease into their new home life. Be careful not to let the dog fall into bad habits due to grief. For example, if the dog turns up its nose at food, just let the food sit there until the dog is ready to eat it. Don\u2019t \u201creward\u201d the behavior by making a fuss.\n2. Take care of your own grief. If you knew the old owner, you may be grieving yourself. This is understandable. Do what you have to so that you can grieve in your own, personal way. This will in turn help the dog by providing a loving, happy home for them. Avoid mourning in front of the dog. Dogs are very sensitive to grief, and they may exhibit signs of mourning if they understand that you are grieving. While it is okay to cry a little in front of the dog, you may want to step into another room to mourn privately.\n3. Reinforce positive behavior. During this time, you may notice that the dog is whining, crying, or acting out. While you may want to give the dog a treat during these episodes, you should avoid rewarding them for this behavior. The dog may learn that they will earn treats if they whine. Instead, reward the dog when they are being good, such as when they are quietly resting. For example, you may notice that the dog is sitting outside of your bedroom door at night and whining. Instead of waking up to comfort the dog, go back to sleep. In the morning, you can pet and talk to the dog. If they are well-behaved, give them a treat with their breakfast. Good times to treat the dog are when the dog is resting quietly, when the dog is sitting with you, or right before you leave the house.\n4. Weigh the pros and cons of getting a new dog. While a new dog companion might provide company for the dog, many older dogs do not do well with a new younger dog in the house. While some older dogs may enjoy having a puppy around, others may snap at the younger dog or bully them. Consider carefully whether a new dog is appropriate for the older dog. Also keep in mind that bringing in a new companion for the dog will not make them miss their old owner any less. If a friend or family member has a puppy, ask if they can be introduced to your older dog. This will show you how well the dog deals with energetic puppies. If the older dog plays, cuddles, or gets along with the puppy, you might consider getting a younger dog. Try taking the dog to a dog park when it\u2019s not too crowded, and see if the dog seems to enjoy being around other dogs. If so, then you might consider bringing home a new dog. Another option is to adopt an older or senior dog. Try to find one with a similar temperament. See if the dogs can meet first before you adopt to see if they are friendly with one another.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

However, face masks should be used along with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand washing.\n5. Stay healthy. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food. The healthier you are, the better your immune system will be at defending your body against a virus.\n\n\n## Preparation\n\n1. Know what to expect. A vaccine for pandemic flu may not be available for 4-6 months after a pandemic starts, and even then, it may only be available in limited amounts. People will have little or no immunity to pandemic flu since it is a new virus to humans. With seasonal flu, people have some immunity built up from previous exposure to the viruses. Symptoms of pandemic flu may be more severe than seasonal flu. More people are likely to die from pandemic flu than from seasonal flu.\n2. Stock up. Store nonperishable foods, bottled water, over-the-counter drugs, health supplies, and other necessities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends having a 2-week supply. (These supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages.) Have basic, over-the-counter health supplies such as a thermometer, facemasks, tissues, soap, hand sanitizers, medicine to relieve fever, and cold medicine.\n3. Plan ahead. Plan for what you will do in the following cases:\n\t* Schools dismissed: Consider childcare needs. Plan home learning activities and exercises. Have materials, such as books, on hand. Also plan recreational activities that your children can do at home. You or family member becomes sick and requires care: Make plans for how to care for people with special needs in case the services they rely on are not available. Plan to stay home for at least 10 days when you are sick with pandemic flu. Staying home will keep you from giving it to others. Make sure others in your household also stay home when they are sick. During a severe pandemic, stay home if someone in your household is sick with pandemic flu. Transportation networks disrupted. Think about how you can rely less on public transportation during a pandemic. For example, store food and other essential supplies so you can make fewer trips to the store. Prepare backup plans for taking care of loved ones who are far away. Consider other ways to get to work, or, if you can, work at home.\n4. Talk to your employer. Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. You can Develop a Risk Management Plan that accounts for the possibility of a flu pandemic. Find out if you can work from home, or if your employer will consider virtualizing the workforce. Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed. Check with your employer or union about leave policies.\n5. Stay updated. Identify sources you can count on for reliable information. If a pandemic occurs, having accurate and reliable information will be critical. Reliable, accurate, and timely information is available at http:\/\/www.pandemicflu.gov. Another source for information on pandemic influenza is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hotline at: 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). This line is available in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY: 1-888-232-6348. If you do not live in the U.S., check if there is an equivalent hotline in your area. Look for information on your local and state government Web sites. Review your state's planning efforts and those of your local public health and emergency preparedness officials. Listen to local and national radio, watch news reports on television, and read your newspaper and other sources of printed and Web-based information.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Planning,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to make your dog more playful?","response":"Some dogs are naturally more playful than others. Additionally, some breeds are also generally more sociable than other dog breeds. If you\u2019re dog seems bored, lonely, or unhappy, there are many ways you can try to address their malaise. In order to make your dog more playful, it\u2019s important to play with your dog regularly, bond with your dog, and pay attention to your dog\u2019s needs. Making your dog more playful will make both you and your pet happier in your relationship.\n\n## Play with your dog regularly\n\n1. Play fetch or other retrieving exercises with your dog. Dogs like to chase and retrieve items, including bones and balls. If you can, try to train your dog to come to you before you throw the item and then bring it back to you once they retrieve it. Say \u201ccome\u201d and get your dog to approach you. Get your dog to sit by putting the ball on their forehead and stating \u201csit\u201d\n\t* When you throw the ball, tell your dog to \u201cget it\u201d. After they retrieve it, tell them \u201cbring it here\u201d to have them take it back to you to throw again.\n2. Get or make dog toys for a variety of activities. Show off the toy to your dog, but don\u2019t play with it immediately. Try tug toys or braided rope toys that you can play back and forth with them. You can also try teething or training toys that can strengthen your dog\u2019s teeth. Talk excitedly to your dog about the toy by saying things like \u201cWhere is it?\u201d in reference to the dog toy. If your dog wants to play, they should begin wagging their tale and get excited. When you take out the dog toy, play with it first before you start playing with the dog. Use the toy to play with the dog for a brief amount of time before they get tired with it. This will help build their excitement for the next time you break out the dog toys.\n3. Play hunting and hiding games with your dog. Dogs like finding people and objects that are hidden. These types of games can stimulate your dog\u2019s mind and their senses. While your dog is in the other room, hide in another room. Call them to come and find you. When they do, give them treats and dog toys to reward them. You can also hide doggie treats somewhere in the yard or in a room. When your dog comes into the room, they should sniff around in search of the treat. Give them encouragement when they get closer or farther away from finding the treat.\n4. Invite other dogs over to play. Your dog might get happy when he's around other dogs. For many dogs, having some friendly play with their fellow canines can be engaging and exciting. Your dog may like to roughhouse, but make sure things do not get out of hand. When they are play fighting, dogs will often avoid really biting the other dog and roll over often. If your dog is growling when playing with other dogs, their play fighting may have escalated into real fighting. You can also tell if they begin baring their teeth while wrestling with the other dog.\n5. Teach your dog tricks. Dog tricks can be fun, but also very useful. While there are many different tricks you can teach your dog, a few essential tricks can really show off your dog\u2019s ability and make them more playful. Rollover is one easy trick to teach your dog. When your dog is lying down, move a food lure across its muzzle, neck, and shoulders. Use the command \u201cRoll over\u201d while doing so to get them to associate your command with the action. Stay can also be a very useful command. Ask your dog to sit in front of you while holding a treat and maintaining eye contact. If they are able to stay still, reward them with the treat and add the command \u201cStay\u201d so they know what to do when you state the command. A \u201cGo to\u201d command can be useful in directing your dog. With a treat, walk to a whichever place you want them to go and place the treat there. Eventually, they will associate the place with the treat and with your specific \u201cGo to\u201d command.\n6. Take your dog to a dog park. Dog parks can a fun place for your dog to play with other dogs. It\u2019s important for your dog to be able to play well with other dogs, so they don\u2019t get into any fights with other dogs. After you\u2019ve walked around the park with the dog to make sure it\u2019s safe, you can take off their leash so they can run around. You\u2019ll want to know where your dog is at all times, but not having a leash gives them greater freedom to roam around the park. If you have a small dog, try to bring them specifically to a section of the park with other small dogs. Otherwise, they may get overwhelmed.\n\n\n## Bond with your dog\n\n1. Show physical affection to your dog. Dogs like physical affection, and it can bond them closer to their owners. Spend time petting or grooming your dog nearly every day. Dogs can be sensitive to touch at first. Touching them each day can build up their sensitivity and get them to crave your touch. You can also groom them on a regular basis. Just something as simple as brushing their coat with a brush can show your dog physical affection.\n2. Spend one-on-one time with your dog every day. Even if you're at work all day, it's good to have some time alone with your dog. Taking your dog for a walk every day can be a good way to reaffirm your bond with your dog. If you go on a walk with your dog, make it an engaging activity for your dog. Instead of walking aimlessly, try to give your dog specific goals and landmarks to walk or run to that you can do together. Talk to your dog or teach them a trick. If you try a new trick every few weeks, this will bond you and your dog together and keep them focused on doing well for you.\n3. Do focused activities with your dog. Dogs like to have structure, since it gives them a clear sense of purpose. When you play with your dog, try to make them task-oriented. Give them directions on where to run, jump, and play. Playing catch is a good example of directed play. Dogs also like to please their owners. Focused activities can tell your dog that they have fulfilled your expectations and you're happy with them.\n4. Give praise to your dog. When you are training your dog, it\u2019s especially good to give positive reinforcement. Additionally, praising your dog can make you grow closer together. While treats may be the most common type of positive reinforcement, it\u2019s also important to speak to your dog positively. They will associate your tone of voice with your mood and feel happy as well. If your dog does not respond to treats, a toy may also be a good way to praise your dog. They may also like physical affection from you, such as being petted, as a method of praise.\n5. Start obedience training. Dogs like to be trained, since they like structure. You can either have your dog join a class or do it just with you. In either case, you should be heavily involved in any training with your dog. If you are training your dog, always use positive reinforcement. Dogs like treats and voice training (like \"Good boy\") that tell them they are doing well. Pay attention to your dog's mood. They need to be in the right mood for training. Otherwise, it will not be an effective training session and will be frustrated with you and your dog.\n6. Take your dog to a training or activity class. If you're working a specific skill or behavior, a training or activity class can be fun for you to do with your dog. These classes can be good for you and your dog to use to bond over a shared activity. Activity classes can work from puppies to adult dogs. For puppies, these activity classes may be especially useful to teach them discipline and some general training. If you have a new dog that's not a puppy, it may be a good idea to bring them to a training class. Even if they are trained, you and your dog could use the class to learn how to work together.\n\n\n## Pay attention to your dog\u2019s need\n\n1. Know your dog's likes and dislikes. Since not all dogs are the same, every dog has different things they like and don't like. Paying attention to things like their favorite and least favorite things let them know you care. Your dog likely has favorite foods, toys, and games. Give them these things, so they will affiliated their favorites with you. Stay away from things you know your dog dislikes. Some things that all dogs dislikes are head pats, hugging, floral smells, and loud noises.\n2. Read your dog's body language. Your dog gives you plenty of clues how they feel. Watch your dog during activities and you should be able to tell if they are enjoying them or not. When your dog is playful, they are performing a \"play bow\". In the play bow, their rear end is up and their front end is down. Dogs that are whining, pacing, or doing anything unusual are usually stressed or fearful. These activities show you that your dog is not ready to play and likely needs to calm down. Tail wagging can mean many things. While a loose wag means your dog is open and comfortable, a tight wag can mean they are agitated.\n3. Put yourself in a calm state of mind. Very often, your dog's mood will reflect your mood. If you are happy and playful, your dog is more likely to also be happy and playful. Dogs try to read your intention. If you seem uncertain about your intention, they may try to guess; often, they may guess incorrectly. Be clear even when you are calm. Dogs like directions, so it's good to tell them what you want and when.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to do a deep treatment?","response":"A deep moisturizing treatment, protein treatment, or hair mask, can be store bought or homemade. A deep treatment is a great way to improve dry or damaged hair because it moisturizes and strengthens the hair. Read on to learn how to apply one!\n\n## Basic deep treatment\n\n1. Obtain the deep treatment. You can buy one from a store or make your own see below for recipes in \"Related wikiHows\" that you can make at home.\n2. Wash your hair. The hair should be freshly washed before applying the treatment so it can soak in properly. Don't wait until your hair dries to apply the treatment.\n3. Apply the deep treatment to your whole head of hair. Use a comb or brush to distribute the product.\n4. Put your hair up in a towel turban, shower cap, heating cap, etc. This will keep the deep treatment on your hair, and not on your clothes.\n5. Wait for 15 minutes to an hour. Or you can sleep while wearing the deep treatment.\n6. Take the cap off, rinse your hair, and style as usual.\n7. Enjoy your soft, moisturized hair!\n\n\n## Avocado mask deep treatment\n\n1. Get your ingredients. For your deep conditioning mask, you'll need 1 egg-white, 1 avocado, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a tablespoon of honey. These measurements can be altered depending on how long and thick you hair is.\n2. Mix the ingredients. Using a blender or food processor, add all your ingredients and blend them on high until a creamy consistency has formed. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the ingredients together manually, but it will take a bit more time.\n3. Apply the mixture to your hair. Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips, and spread it throughout your hair, focusing primarily on the ends of each strand. When you've used all of the mask, you can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap to prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes.\n4. Let the mask set. Leave the mask for 20-30 minutes to allow time for it to soak into your hair. You can leave it on for longer if you would like, but make sure that you wait at least 20 minutes.\n5. Rinse out the mask. Remove your shower-cap and run your hair under warm water in the shower. Using just the warm water, wash out all of the remaining mask. If you need to, you can use shampoo, but try to avoid it because it will dry out your hair again. When you're finished washing your hair out, dry your hair with a towel.\n6. Repeat the process. You can apply this mask to your hair 1-2 times a week for the optimal results. Otherwise, apply this avocado mask to your hair whenever it starts to appear dull, frizzy, or is dry and damaged to the touch.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"A deep moisturizing treatment can be store bought.","max_prob":41.4717597961,"ccp":-0.7835466189},{"claim":"A deep moisturizing treatment can be homemade.","max_prob":28.7807884216,"ccp":-0.9521952813},{"claim":"A protein treatment can be store bought.","max_prob":28.4384231567,"ccp":-0.0005090626},{"claim":"A protein treatment can be homemade.","max_prob":15.7474536896,"ccp":-0.0005090626},{"claim":"A hair mask can be store bought.","max_prob":20.1102828979,"ccp":-0.111632902},{"claim":"A hair mask can be homemade.","max_prob":3.6091060638,"ccp":-0.333526224},{"claim":"A deep treatment is a way to improve dry or damaged hair.","max_prob":13.8220319748,"ccp":-0.5637729092},{"claim":"A deep treatment is a great way to improve dry or damaged hair.","max_prob":16.0207881927,"ccp":-0.7301990411},{"claim":"A deep treatment moisturizes the hair.","max_prob":7.2341637611,"ccp":-0.970312813},{"claim":"A deep treatment strengthens the hair.","max_prob":4.0262618065,"ccp":-0.9165431335},{"claim":"The hair should be freshly washed.","max_prob":7.1573138237,"ccp":-0.3997735605},{"claim":"The treatment should be applied to the hair.","max_prob":5.5736107826,"ccp":-0.4633353817},{"claim":"Washing the hair before applying the treatment helps it soak in properly.","max_prob":16.458190918,"ccp":-0.3578785352},{"claim":"You need 1 egg-white for your deep conditioning mask.","max_prob":23.5366897583,"ccp":-0.0325447468},{"claim":"You need 1 avocado for your deep conditioning mask.","max_prob":12.4460201263,"ccp":-0.0558015164},{"claim":"You need a tablespoon of olive oil for your deep conditioning mask.","max_prob":16.5281066895,"ccp":-0.0326513932},{"claim":"You need a tablespoon of honey for your deep conditioning mask.","max_prob":15.8505573273,"ccp":-0.0459019671},{"claim":"You can mash the ingredients together manually.","max_prob":8.9288578033,"ccp":-0.9231728035},{"claim":"Mashing the ingredients together manually will take a bit more time.","max_prob":14.3252801895,"ccp":-0.2507119589},{"claim":"Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips.","max_prob":10.0587053299,"ccp":-0.0346568123},{"claim":"Spread the mask throughout your hair.","max_prob":5.6396727562,"ccp":-0.3115904887},{"claim":"Focus primarily on the ends of each strand when spreading the mask.","max_prob":17.4980831146,"ccp":-0.2653717398},{"claim":"You can use all of the mask.","max_prob":7.4470243454,"ccp":-0.4024412235},{"claim":"You can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap.","max_prob":13.2076425552,"ccp":-0.0826803026},{"claim":"Wrapping your hair in a shower-cap can prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes.","max_prob":22.546289444,"ccp":-0.010759181},{"claim":"There is a mask.","max_prob":0.3211740553,"ccp":-0.9083750088},{"claim":"The mask should be left for 20-30 minutes.","max_prob":7.084733963,"ccp":-0.1701399898},{"claim":"The mask needs time to soak into your hair.","max_prob":6.7226681709,"ccp":-0.9045585185},{"claim":"You can leave it on for longer if you would like.","max_prob":10.0116147995,"ccp":-0.4568233072},{"claim":"You should wait at least 20 minutes.","max_prob":6.6051273346,"ccp":-0.0426370453},{"claim":"You can apply this mask to your hair.","max_prob":5.6204047203,"ccp":-0.8182844311},{"claim":"The mask can be applied 1-2 times a week.","max_prob":4.1537270546,"ccp":-0.279927284},{"claim":"Applying the mask 1-2 times a week is for optimal results.","max_prob":10.9655504227,"ccp":-0.279927284}]}
{"instruction":"How to freeze lasagna?","response":"Freezing homemade lasagna is a great way to have ready-made meals on hand for nights when it's all you can do to turn the oven on and heat up dinner. When you make lasagna and freeze it for later, you'll have a homemade, healthy meal on hand whenever you need it. You can freeze lasagna baked or unbaked, but you'll need to thaw it overnight before cooking it to serve. See Step 1 to learn how to freeze lasagna so that it stays fresh-tasting.\n\n## Prepare the lasagna\n\n1. Make a freezer-friendly lasagna recipe. Some ingredients taste better than others when they're reheated after being frozen. Most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing, whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. However, if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once, it's best not to freeze and thaw them twice. This increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria. For example, don't plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. Instead, use fresh meat or leave it out completely. Food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. Choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best-tasting lasagna. If your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient, the final dish usually won't be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. For example, instead of using frozen mushrooms, just use fresh. In most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.\n2. Assemble the lasagna in a dish that can be frozen. Look for a \"freezer-proof\" label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. Most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose. Avoid using an aluminum pan for long-term storage of lasagna. The food might end up picking up a tinny taste. If you don't have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna, you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer-safe food storage container.\n3. Decide whether to bake it first. Lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. Lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious, too. Use whichever method is most convenient for you, since the final texture and taste of the dish won't be too affected either way. You might decide to freeze pre-baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch. If you'd rather freeze it before baking, consider making two lasagnas next time you're having lasagna for dinner. You can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.\n4. Bring the lasagna to room temperature. If you want to freeze baked lasagna, it's necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. Otherwise, the texture of the dish won't be as pleasant when it's time to eat it. After making the lasagna, set it aside for one hour to cool. You can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. Before placing it in the fridge, cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.\n5. Cover the lasagna with freezer-safe plastic wrap. Don't use aluminum foil, since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. Cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. You may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish, rather than just over the top. That way, you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn. Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. This way you won't have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. Cut the lasagna into serving sized-portions after it has chilled. This will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. Put each piece in its own freezer-safe storage bag. No matter what, make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.\n6. Freeze the lasagna. Label it and place it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to three months, whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.\n\n\n## Thaw and reheat lasagna\n\n1. Thaw it overnight. The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.\n2. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC\/350\u00baF. This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.\n3. Ready the lasagna for baking. Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.\n4. Bake the lasagna. Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna. If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.\n5. Serve the lasagna. Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to address a queen?","response":"Queens are typically addressed as \"Your Majesty,\" but in modern times there is rarely any enforcement or punishment for getting it wrong. Queen Elizabeth II, the most famous living monarch, has been winked at by a U.S. president, among many other gaffes she's witnessed over the years. The royal family lives on, and the correct etiquette to use remains, at least in the British case, a suggested tradition rather than a requirement.\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in a letter\n\n1. Decide whether to use traditional forms. According to the Royal Family's official policy, you should be free to write in whatever style you like. Politeness and respect will make any letter more kindly received, but that does not necessarily equate to using formal terms. Stay sincere, and do not use the formal terms below if they make you uncomfortable.\n2. Begin the letter with \"Madam.\" At the top of your letter, write \"Madam,\" skip a line, and start writing your letter on the line below it. This is the formal and traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.\n3. Conclude the letter with a respectful term. The traditional written conclusion is I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant, followed by your name. If you find this conclusion distasteful due to the declaration of servitude, or the insertion of the letter u in honour, consider one of the following respectful conclusions instead:\n\t* With greatest respect,\n\t* Yours faithfully,\n\t* Yours sincerely,\n4. Mail the letter. On the envelope, write the following postal address, using the last line only if you are mailing the letter from outside the UK:\n\t* The Queen\n\t* Buckingham Palace\n\t* London SW1A 1AA\n\t* United Kingdom\n\n\n## Address queen elizabeth ii in person\n\n1. Make a small curtsy, bow, or nod. Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy and men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom. This is no longer required, but citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting. People who are not subjects of the Queen often prefer to use a slight nod instead. Do not bow from the waist.\n2. Politely shake the Queen's hand if offered. The Queen may or may not offer her hand, although there is no special significance to one decision or the other. If she does offer her hand, take it in a brief, gentle handshake. Do not offer your hand first.\n3. Wait for Her Majesty to address you. A good general rule, in fact, is not to initiate an action or conversation until the Queen has addressed you directly. Needless to say, wait until the Queen finishes speaking before you reply.\n4. Address her as \"Your Majesty\" the first time in the conversation. If you are stuck for words, say \"Hello, Your Majesty. I am delighted to meet you.\" Any polite greeting is acceptable, however.\n5. Address her as \"Ma'am\" for the rest of the conversation. For the rest of the conversation, say, \"Ma'am,\" pronounced to rhyme with \"jam.\" You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" again if you are asking her a question or introducing someone, but \"Ma'am\" will do most of the time.\n6. Don't ask personal questions. Most likely, the Queen will be guiding the conversation. But if you contribute your own small talk, avoid asking her about her family or personal life.\n7. Don't turn your back on the Queen until the conversation is over. Remain facing her or standing to the side throughout the conversation. Turn away or leave only when the conversation is over. And of course, don't forget to give her a proper good-bye and thank Her Majesty for the unexpected opportunity.\n\n\n## Address queen of other nations\n\n1. Try to find the specific form of address. Monarchies often have specific terms of address borne of their countries' traditions. Search online or in etiquette books for the terms of address for the specific monarchy.\n2. When in doubt, use \"Your Majesty.\" The term \"Your Majesty\" is common and unlikely to cause offense. This term is the proper way to address most queens, from Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha of Brunei, to Queen Mathilde of Belgium. Use \"Her Majesty\" instead of \"her\" when writing or speaking about these queens in the third person.\n3. Address Empresses as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\" If a monarch's title includes \"Empress,\" or if the nation she heads traditionally considers itself an empire, she should be addressed as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\"\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Queens are typically addressed as \"Your Majesty.\"","max_prob":19.9806518555,"ccp":-0.2009530557},{"claim":"In modern times, there is rarely any enforcement for getting the address of queens wrong.","max_prob":40.1920814514,"ccp":-0.0078197525},{"claim":"In modern times, there is rarely any punishment for getting the address of queens wrong.","max_prob":33.0886039734,"ccp":-0.0076222712},{"claim":"Queen Elizabeth II is the most famous living monarch.","max_prob":14.3609113693,"ccp":-0.2946875129},{"claim":"A U.S. president has winked at Queen Elizabeth II.","max_prob":29.5150642395,"ccp":-0.427260314},{"claim":"Queen Elizabeth II has witnessed many gaffes over the years.","max_prob":13.1503667831,"ccp":-0.2955491714},{"claim":"The royal family lives on.","max_prob":14.9232683182,"ccp":-0.4928374205},{"claim":"The correct etiquette to use remains a suggested tradition in the British case.","max_prob":48.8682098389,"ccp":-0.3656670762},{"claim":"The correct etiquette to use is not a requirement in the British case.","max_prob":33.8154067993,"ccp":-0.1794051002},{"claim":"The Royal Family has an official policy.","max_prob":13.2790126801,"ccp":-0.5751083681},{"claim":"The policy states that you should be free to write in whatever style you like.","max_prob":32.7173690796,"ccp":-0.0257253864},{"claim":"Politeness will make any letter more kindly received.","max_prob":26.3564815521,"ccp":-0.6366896264},{"claim":"Respect will make any letter more kindly received.","max_prob":25.837184906,"ccp":-0.7277132476},{"claim":"There is a formal term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.","max_prob":23.7687740326,"ccp":-0.3280040231},{"claim":"There is a traditional term of address when writing a letter to the Queen of the United Kingdom.","max_prob":21.5942840576,"ccp":-0.8660008841},{"claim":"The traditional written conclusion is \"I have the honour to be, Madam, Your Majesty's most humble and obedient servant.\"","max_prob":32.5738182068,"ccp":-0.2205767566},{"claim":"The traditional written conclusion is followed by your name.","max_prob":16.631696701,"ccp":-0.7044554975},{"claim":"Traditionally, women do a discreet curtsy when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom.","max_prob":25.9596920013,"ccp":-0.3539956815},{"claim":"Traditionally, men bow from the neck when they meet the Queen of the United Kingdom.","max_prob":15.6763715744,"ccp":-0.1638586374},{"claim":"This is no longer required.","max_prob":4.5601887703,"ccp":-0.4224298345},{"claim":"Citizens of the Commonwealth usually choose to use this greeting.","max_prob":31.886346817,"ccp":-0.1789559031},{"claim":"You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" if you are asking her a question.","max_prob":19.6570491791,"ccp":-0.8058940917},{"claim":"You may use the term \"Your Majesty\" if you are introducing someone.","max_prob":16.3947868347,"ccp":-0.8912272613},{"claim":"\"Ma'am\" will suffice most of the time.","max_prob":9.1669149399,"ccp":-0.9757088263},{"claim":"Monarchies often have specific terms of address.","max_prob":10.9915561676,"ccp":-0.9996915054},{"claim":"These terms of address are borne of their countries' traditions.","max_prob":28.1675643921,"ccp":-0.0663989513},{"claim":"The term \"Your Majesty\" is common.","max_prob":7.0251522064,"ccp":-0.6813545571},{"claim":"The term \"Your Majesty\" is unlikely to cause offense.","max_prob":11.4750061035,"ccp":-0.0009216024},{"claim":"Queen Pengiran Anak Saleha is a queen of Brunei.","max_prob":20.4234447479,"ccp":-0.0000000331},{"claim":"Queen Mathilde is a queen of Belgium.","max_prob":7.5510268211,"ccp":-0.0693075406},{"claim":"Empresses should be addressed as \"Her Imperial Majesty.\"","max_prob":13.6092910767,"ccp":-0.0574566116}]}

{"instruction":"How to make churros?","response":"The Mexican version of a quick fried cake, churros are incredible tasty treats that couldn't be easier to make. Whether you want to craft them from scratch or are looking for a quicker fix, anyone can whip up a batch of churros at home.\n\n## Make fresh churros\n\n1. Whip the two eggs together with the vanilla in a small bowl. It should be well blended and mixed. When done, set it aside for later. To make richer churros, you can add 1-2 more eggs, though this is totally up to taste.\n2. Heat up 1-1\/2\" of oil in a large frying pan until 375\u00b0F. If you don't have a candy thermometer, keep everything on medium-low, and you'll be ready just as small amounts of \"smoke\" is rising from the top of the oil. If you drop a small test ball of dough in, the oil should immediately start bubbling. A thick-bottomed pan is always your best bet, as they hold heat much better than thinner pans. You can also wait to pre-heat the oil until after you've made the dough. However, this can take some time, so starting now is a good idea if you think you can do the dough quickly. If you do, just keep the burner on medium, not high, to prevent burning.\n3. In a medium saucepan, add the water, brown sugar, salt, and butter and heat until boiling. Stir it frequently, until everything is well dissolved and the mixture is bubbling nicely. Once it is a consistent, boiling mixture, immediately lower the heat to low.\n4. Add the flour to the hot water mixture all at once, stirring until a firm dough. This takes some arms, so really get in there with a wooden spoon to stir everything up into it is well blended. Turn the heat off when done.\n5. Pour the egg\/vanilla mixture in and stir until you have a consistent dough. You should have a glossy ball of dough when you've mixed everything up completely. If you pull up on the dough sharply, it should keep it's hook shape. If it doesn't add and beat in another egg.\n6. Consider how you want to make the long, round shapes churros are famous for. There are a lot of ways to turn your ball of dough into long, delicious churros, and none of them are wrong. Use whatever works for you, making long, thin, cylindrical treats:\n\t* \n\t* Pinch and Roll: The simplest method, simply pull off a 2\" ball of dough and roll it between your hands to form a snake-like shape, roughly 1\/2\" thick. Decorative Piper: Usually used for icing, these have star-shaped tips that will get the ridges found on fairground churros. Pack the dough where the icing goes and then push it through to make perfect, even logs of dough. DIY Decorative Piper: Take a large freezer back and fill it with dough. Then cut the bottom corner off the bag to form a small opening. Squeeze the dough through this whole to make your logs.\n7. Fry the logs in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, turning frequently. The total cooking time will depend on how thick the churros are, but you should be able to tell easily when they are done, as the outsides will be an alluring golden brown. Don't put more than 3-4 churros in the pan at once -- too much will drop the temperature of the oil rapidly, leading to greasy churros.\n8. Drain the finished churros on paper towels. Set them aside on a plate of paper towels, then lightly pat down the tops with more paper towels to get rid of excess oil.\n9. Combine white sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and roll the churros in the mixture. You've got your finished churros! Combine them in as much or as little cinnamon sugar as you want -- they'll be delicious either way. Some people take things a step further by drizzling the finished churros in chocolate sauce, too.\n\n\n## Make \"instant\" churros\n\n1. Purchase a roll of pre-made biscuits from your favorite brand. The dough in a \"real\" churro is a little different than the dough in a biscuit, but the basic ingredients are the same and they will cook similarly. It is usually best to use the smaller biscuits, allowing you to more easily fry everything. If you don't want the fat of biscuit batter, you can use 1 cup hot water and 3-1\/4 cups of your favorite all-purpose pancake mix. Blend into a dough and proceed like normal.\n2. Take two biscuits and roll them in between your hands into ten-inch ropes. Churros need to be long and thin in order to really cook nicely. Try to make all the ropes roughly the same diameter for the best results.\n3. Twist biscuits together and pinch ends. Simply make a rope out of the biscuits by braiding one over the other, When done, pinch both ends together to fuse them. You can also lightly roll the whole thing together to keep the centers together.\n4. Alternatively, use an icing pipette or icing bag to pump out the strips. Simply put the dough into a large plastic bag, then snip off the bottom corner with scissors. You can push the dough straight out the bottom of the back in perfect strips.\n5. Pour vegetable oil into a medium-sized frying pan. Heat until it reached 375F. Make sure there is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of oil in the pan to cover the churros. There should be enough oil so that they float freely while frying, and all sides, except the very top, are being cooked at the same time. If you don't have an oil thermometer, 375 is when there is barely smoke coming off the top of the oil. Don't let it get much farther than this point.\n6. Drop the dough twists into the pan, turning occasionally. Fry for about 2 minutes, or until golden brown. They don't take long, but you can easily see when they are finished by the color on the outsides. Once they look good to eat, they usually are.\n7. Remove the churros with the slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel. Pat them down with paper towels to remove excess oil, which will make them soggy if it cools on the churro.\n8. Roll the twisted dough in cinnamon and sugar mixture. In a separate bowl, mix up 1\/2 cup of sugar with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Then roll the warm churros in the mixture to coat them deliciously.\n9. Serve warm, with chocolate dip if desired. They are fine on their own or with a delicious chocolate dip.

{"instruction":"How to take care of kittens?","response":"## Help your female cat give birth and care for newborns (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Provide a quiet place for the birth. Your female cat will chose a place where she feels safe to give birth. By all means, provide a large cardboard box, turn it on its side and line it with warm, dry bedding\u2013but don't be disappointed if she has other ideas. Instinct tells her to find a quiet concealed spot, such as under a bed, behind a sofa, or inside a kitchen cabinet. To learn more about helping your cat give birth, see this article.\n2. Do not disturb during the birth and first two days. The first 48 hours is a crucial time for the mother to bond with her kittens, so try not to disturb her. If she gives birth under your bed, leave her there. Moving the newborn kittens will distress the mother and in the worst scenario could cause her to reject them. Once she is firmly bonded, at around four or five days, if you feel it's necessary to move the kittens, do it then.\n3. Leave food, water, and cat litter in the room. The mother won't want to leave her kittens for long in the first two weeks of their life. Always put food and water within stretching distance of her nest, and if possible, offer a litter tray in the same room so that she can stay within sight and sound of the kittens. If food is in another room, some mothers chose to starve rather than leave their newborn kittens to find it.\n4. Feed the mother extra calories. She needs the extra calories to make milk for her kittens. Feed her kitten food, which has more calories than adult cat food.\n5. Let Mom do most of the clean-ups. Instinct helps the mother to keep the nest clean. The newborn kittens do not urinate or defecate on their own, so the mother has to lick their bottoms before and after feeding to stimulate elimination. This way she keeps the nest clean. Try to disturb the nest as little as possible. If the bedding becomes soiled, wait until Mom hops out for a toilet break herself to take out the dirty bedding and pop in clean.\n6. Check that the kittens are all nursing. If the mother cat is present, the kittens should nurse from her immediately after the last kitten is born. Newborn kittens will spend most of their time sleeping, waking up to nurse every two to three hours. If they do not appear to be nursing, or one kitten is being pushed away from the mother cat by its siblings, supplement with bottle feeding as described in Part 2.\n7. Consider spaying the mother cat. Having your mother cat spayed (removing her womb) after the kittens are done nursing (they should be weaned by about 8 weeks) is highly recommended by veterinarians and humane organizations. This helps prevent the suffering of unwanted kittens, and can also have some health benefits for the spayed cat. Be aware that a cat can potentially fall pregnant again as little as three to four days after giving birth, so keep her indoors to avoid this risk.\n8. Start to think about deworming the kittens. This can happen as early as two weeks if necessary. Consult a veterinarian for proper medication and dosing.\n\n\n## Care for orphan kitten (0 to 4 weeks)\n\n1. Feed the kittens a milk replacement. Powdered cat milk replacer (such as Cimicat) can be purchased from the vet clinic, major pet stores, or on the Internet. Another good milk replacer is KMR. This is the cat equivalent of infant formula, with the same composition as queen's (mother's) milk. The milk replacer has guidelines as to how much to feed in each meal. Do not feed cow's milk to the kitten as the lactose is likely to upset the kitten's stomach. If you have no milk replacement and a hungry kitten, offer some cooled boiled water in a dropper or syringe until you can get to the vet clinic or pet store. The water keeps the kitten hydrated and won't upset her tummy.\n2. Use a kitten feeding bottle with a specially designed kitten teat. You can purchase this at a vet clinic, a major pet store, or on the Internet. In an emergency use an eyedropper or a small syringe to drip the milk replacement into the kitten's mouth.\n3. Burp the kittens after each meal. You do this much as you would a baby: hold the kitten up straight against your shoulder, or place one hand under its belly. Gently pat and rub its back.\n4. Stimulate the kittens to eliminate. Before and after each feed, wipe the kitten's bottom with a paper towel or gauze pad soaked in warm water. This stimulates the kitten to go to the toilet, which otherwise she would not do. Hold the kitten over a litter box and use the towel to rub the kitten's genitals and anal region after every meal. Continue to do this until the urination and defecation is over (when nothing else is coming out). Rub in just one direction\u2013rubbing back and forth is irritating. Cotton balls or pads are not recommended because they shed.\n5. Look for signs of healthy elimination. Urine should be pale yellow and odorless, and stools should be yellowish-brown, formed in tiny logs. Dark, pungent urine is a sign of dehydration; green stool may be a sign of over-feeding, while white stool could indicate malabsorption, a serious problem. Call your vet if you have any concerns. If the kitten does not urinate for 12 hours, take her to the vet's immediately. Most kittens poop once a day, but individual schedules vary. Take her to the vet's if she hasn't pooped in more than two days.\n6. Follow the kittens' meal times. In the first two weeks of life the kitten feeds every two to three hours around the clock. The kitten will tell you she is hungry by crying and wriggling around as if hunting for a nipple. A full kitten often falls asleep while suckling and has a rounded belly. After two weeks, the feeds can be stretched out to to every three to four hours, with a gap of six hours overnight.\n7. Keep the kittens warm with a covered heating pad. Neonatal kittens (under two weeks of age) cannot regulate their body temperature and usually keep warm by snuggling up to their mother. You can simulate this situation by keeping them on a heated pad designed for puppies or kittens. Avoid putting them in direct contact with the pad: if the kitten is in direct contact with the heat pad, she might be at risk of either local burns or overheating. However, these pads usually come in a fleece cover so it shouldn't be a problem, except for when you remove the cover for washing, in which case substitute a towel. As the kitten gets older (over two weeks), she is able to move away from the heat if she gets too hot.\n8. Never feed a cold kitten. If a kitten's body feels cold, you need to warm her up gradually. A kitten is cold if her ears and\/or the pads of her feet feel chilly to the touch. Put your finger in her mouth: if it feels cold, the kitten's body temperature is too low, which can be life-threatening. Warm her up slowly by wrapping her in a fleece blanket and holding her next to your body, rubbing her gently with your hands for one to two hours.\n9. Learn more about taking care of orphaned kittens. You can start with this article. Contact a veterinarian for information and suggestions. Your vet can also provide vaccinations against common diseases and deworm the kittens. Orphaned kittens may be dewormed starting at two weeks, and, depending on their situation, can be vaccinated starting anywhere from two to eight weeks. They may have weaker immune systems because, unlike other kittens, they don't get the antibodies from their mother's milk.\n\n\n## Wean and socialize your kitten (4 - 8 weeks)\n\n1. Start to leave out extra kitten food. If Mom's around, the weaning process (switching from mother's milk to solid food) happens naturally from about four weeks. At this point, Mom gets tired of the kittens chewing on her teats and starts to spend time apart from them. In turn, the hungry kittens investigate food options around them and usually discover Mom's food. As the kittens start to take mouthfuls of her food, they begin the weaning process.\n2. Provide water. Kittens do not need water until they start weaning, roughly around four weeks old. Any kitten above this age, however, should have constant access to a full water bowl. Change this water whenever it gets dirty (as it tends to if kittens step and\/or poop in the bowl).\n3. Put down kitten food for hand-reared kittens. If you've been bottle-feeding the kittens yourself, the weaning process is similar. It sometimes helps to put some milk-replacer in a saucer and put your finger just beneath the surface to teach the kitten to lap first. Then, it's a matter of mashing up some wet kitten food with the milk-replacer to make a porridge for the kitten to lap. As she gets the hang of that you can thicken up the porridge until she's happily taking most of her calories in solid form.\n4. Socialize your kittens by introducing them to new things. Socialization is crucial during the three-to-nine-week window. From two to three weeks of age, handle the kittens as much as possible every day. Introduce them to different sights and sounds, such as the vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, men with beards, children . . . anything you can think of. During this six-week window the kitten is most open to new experiences, and what she encounters now she will accept without question as an adult, making her into a happy, well-adjusted and sociable cat. Use cat toys, balls, string, or other objects to play with them, but don't use objects small enough for them to swallow. (Note that cats may eat string or yarn if left unsupervised, so only allow this in your interactive play. It's a potential choking hazard.) Don't teach your kittens that human fingers and hands are toys, or the kitten may continue to bite and scratch them as an adult.\n5. Provide non-clumping litter. Choose a spot for the litter box carefully, as once used to it, the kittens will probably continue to use that spot. If litter-training the kittens yourself, simply place the kittens there after each meal, or whenever a kitten starts to crouch and scratch the floor in preparation for pooping. Clean the litter box at least once a day, or the kittens may stop using it. Choose a box with low sides so it's easy for the kittens to get in and out. Avoid clumping litter, as kittens may eat the clumps, which could potentially harm their digestion. If a kitten seems like it doesn't want to stay in the litter box, gently take its paws and imitate digging in the litter. Then, provide the kitten with privacy so it can dig a hole, do its business, and cover it up with some litter.\n6. Keep the cat inside until it has all its shots. Once your veterinarian allows it, you can let the cat outside to explore. Make sure you keep a close watch on it until you're sure it knows to return home. Let the kitten outside when it's a bit hungry. Entice it back in by calling its name and showing it food. This will remind your kitten that while outdoors is fun, its final destination will always be your home.\n7. Give kittens away responsibly. If selling or giving away the kittens, you should wait until they are at least eight weeks old, but twelve weeks old is preferred. Take them to a vet and start their shots before they leave you. Always follow-up with the new owners to make sure the kitten is getting her shots and is scheduled to be spayed or neutered. Exchange phone numbers with the new owners so you can confirm your kitten is in good hands, or in case the owners want to return her (at least you can help her find another home).\n\n\n## Take care of an adopt kitten (8 weeks and beyond)\n\n1. Ask the breeder or shelter for a blanket that smells like the kitten's mother and siblings. These smells help to give the kitten comfort while she settles into her new home.\n2. Ask what kind of food the kitten's been eating. Provide this for the first few days so that you don't make too many changes at once. When the kitten has settled in, this is your chance to change her food to one of your choosing, though do it gradually: replace a small quantity of her former food with the new food, increasing the amount slowly over the course of a week. If the kitten is eating dry kibble, leave a bowl out all day. If she is eating wet food, give her small meals every six hours. Continue to feed kitten food, not adult cat food, until one year of age.\n3. Provide water. Kittens above four weeks of age need water, so clean water should always be available. Cats tend to be more interested in water that is not next to their food bowl. Encourage drinking by placing water bowls in different spots through the house.\n4. Introduce the kitten to your house slowly. Expose the kitten to just one room initially: the whole house will be too overwhelming on the first day. Set up a bed (preferably one that has sides and a roof so the kitten feels safe in a nest), with food and water in one corner of the room, and a litter tray in the opposite corner. Show the kitten where her facilities are, and then leave her to rest. It's been a big day for the little kitten so let her adjust and sleep for a few hours.\n5. Give the kitten as much attention as you can. Spend as much time as possible grooming, playing, fussing and interacting with the kitten. This helps her to grow into a well-socialized, friendly adult.\n6. Keep the kitten and your possessions safe. Keep electrical cords and devices out of the kitten's reach to avoid her chewing on them. Child locks may be a wise investment for low cabinets if you have a particularly inquisitive kitten.\n7. Plan a vet visit. At nine weeks old the kitten can have her first vaccination. This is the ideal time for a vet to examine her, worm her and start vaccinations. The basic kitten vaccine includes protection against cat flu and infectious enteritis. There is also the option to vaccinate against feline leukemia.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to clean slate?","response":"Slate is a stone that brings natural beauty into the home, and can be expensive to install. Regular maintenance cleaning can help preserve slate. But sometimes, it needs a deep clean or stain removal. A combination of regular cleaning and an occasional deep clean can help keep your slate in good condition.\n\n## Maintain a regular clean routine\n\n1. Sweep or remove dust and debris regularly. If you have slate floors, it is important to sweep daily or several times a week. Dust can damage slate over time by wearing away the surface. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule can prevent this damage. Use a dry broom or cloth for this step.\n2. Mix a solution of mild soap and water. For this, you will need a large bucket full of warm water. Mix in a little bit of soap. Dish soap works well for this.\n3. Mop or wipe the surface. Gently wipe the surface of the slate using small circular motions. This motion will loosen and lift dried-on dust and dirt. Use a soft mop, made from materials such as a microfiber. Stiff bristles can damage the stone. For vertical surfaces, clean from the bottom up. Slate should be cleaned with soap every 2-3 months.\n4. Rinse the slate with water. Rinse out your bucket and mop first, and then use them to rinse the slate with water. Soap buildup can attract more dirt, meaning you will have to clean your slate again.\n5. Dry the slate with a fresh, dry, soft cloth. This will remove any streaks from forming on the slate that may occur from air drying and prevent slipping on floor surfaces.\n\n\n## Clean deeply\n\n1. Sweep and mop the slate. Start with removing dry dust and debris by sweeping. Then mop or wipe the slate surface with a soft cloth or microfiber mop in soapy water. Allow the surface to dry.\n2. Apply teak oil to the slate. After the surface is completely dry, apply teak oil to a clean, dry cloth. Using small, circular motions, apply cloth to the slate to cover it in a thin layer of teak oil. Designated slate oil is also available to buy at some hardware stores. However, it tends to be more expensive. Teak oil will achieve the same results.\n3. Clean grout between slate tiles. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. You can find hydrogen peroxide at hardware stores or pharmacies. Spray the solution onto the grout. Avoid direct contact with the eyes when using hydrogen peroxide. Repeat this step as needed if the grout doesn't look clean after the first round.\n4. Reapply sealant as needed. Sealant protects slate from some everyday wear and tear, and is used on interior surfaces. Each sealant is different, so be sure to follow the specific instructions that come with it. In general, apply at least two layers and allow the sealant to dry completely between coats. Each sealant will come with instructions about how often to reapply it.\n\n\n## Remove a stain\n\n1. Mix a solution in a spray bottle that is 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water. Allow the mixture to sit for around 10 minutes.\n2. Spray the solution onto the stain and scrub. Using a soft-bristled brush or microfiber cloth, scrub the stain with small, circular motions. If the stain does not come out, a stronger solution may be needed.\n3. Mix a solution of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. Add a few spoonfuls of baking soda to the peroxide until the mixture becomes bubbly. Wait until the bubbles stop.\n4. Apply the solution to the stain. Once the peroxide and baking soda mix has set, you can wipe it away with a clean cloth.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Slate is a

{"instruction":"How to call the united arab emirates?","response":"The United Arab Emirates, or UAE, is a vibrant nation and tourist destination. Whether you have family and friends there or need to contact a business, you may need to call internationally. Dialing a number in the UAE is simple when you dial the correct exit, country, and area codes. Before you place your call, read about time zone differences and different calling options allowed by the UAE government to save yourself money.\n\n## Dial a uae number\n\n1. Dial your country\u2019s exit code to route the call internationally. Each country has its own exit code, so the number you need to dial varies slightly depending on where you are in the world. The most common exit codes are 00, used throughout Europe, and 011, used for most of North America. Ask your phone service provider for the access code or look it up at https:\/\/www.howtocallabroad.com\/codes.html\n\t* For example, the exit code for Australia is 0011. When you dial the UAE, the phone number looks like 0011+XXX+X+XXX-XXXX. Some countries have multiple exit codes. In Brazil, for example, each phone service provider has its own exit code. If you\u2019re calling from a cell phone, look for a + button on your number pad. Pressing it automatically inputs the exit code. You don\u2019t need to type it in yourself afterward.\n2. Type in 971 to reach the United Arab Emirates. Every country in the world has a unique country code. You will always reach a UAE number by dialing 971. In addition, the country code always comes after your exit code. Make sure you type the correct country code. If you get the code wrong, you may end up calling someone in a different country! After typing the country code, the number you have dialed may look something like 0011+971+X+XXX-XXXX.\n3. Include the area code for the city you wish to call in the UAE. Like in a lot of countries, the UAE is divided up into service regions. Major UAE cities like Dubai are covered by single-digit area codes. For smaller regions like Tarif, the area code is 2 digits long. Find an area code at https:\/\/countrycode.org\/uae. For example, the area code for Dubai is 4. Dial 2 to reach Abu Dhabi instead. The area code always comes after the country code, so the number you have dialed will look like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXXX. If you see a phone number that begins with 0, leave off the 0 when dialing it. For example, you may see a Dubai number with a 04 area code. The 0 is for domestic calls, so dial it only when you're calling from within the UAE.\n4. Use an area code starting with 5 if you\u2019re calling a mobile number. Mobile numbers have a separate area code no matter where you\u2019re calling. The code you need depends on what service provider the other person has. The only way to figure out someone\u2019s mobile phone number is by asking them or figuring out which service provider they use. Mobile codes are always 2 digits long. For example, numbers covered by Etisalat use 50 or 54. Numbers covered by Du often begin with 52 or 55. If you\u2019re calling a mobile number, dial something like 0011+971+55+XXX-XXXX. Like with landlines, avoid dialing 0 if a phone number starts with it. You only need to dial it when you\u2019re calling domestically.\n5. Type in the phone number to complete the call. Phone numbers in the UAE are 7 digits long, excluding the area code. To complete the call, you will need to ask for that phone number or find it online. The finished phone number will look something like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXX. This number places a call to Dubai from Australia.\n\n\n## Manage fee while call\n\n1. Contact your phone carrier to get a calling plan if you make lots of calls. Notify your phone service provider that you plan on calling the UAE. Ask them about the costs and what plans they have available. Many carriers have monthly plans catering to international callers. If you think you\u2019ll need to make lots of calls, such as when contacting family in the UAE, a prepaid plan can save you a lot of money. Note any fees the phone carrier includes in their terms of service. Calling abroad is often costly, so explore your options before settling on a carrier.\n2. Get a prepaid calling plan if you make few calls. A lot of the major phone carriers offer pay as you go plans. You decide in advance how many minutes you wish to buy. When your minutes are up, you can no longer make calls until you buy more data. Prepaid plans are a great way to place international calls without paying for a monthly plan. Your phone calls are limited to what you pay for, so you do need to manage time wisely. However, using limited data prevents you from overspending on long calls.\n3. Buy calling cards for reduced rates if you make short calls. Order an international calling card online or buy one from a telephone service provider. Read the front of the card to find out how many minutes it contains and what rate it charges. Make sure the card is valid for calls to the United Arab Emirates. When you use the card, dial the number on it before dialing your country\u2019s exit code. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find cards available at supermarkets, convenience stores, and other locations. If you visit the UAE, the country\u2019s telecom companies sell prepaid cards that stay valid even while you\u2019re abroad. Read the fine print on the cards carefully to find out what fees come along with placing calls.\n4. Purchase a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone for frequent calls. Find a service provider that sells VoIP phone plans, such as Vonage. Phones equipped with VoIP technology place calls over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines. As a result, you can place international calls at a reduced rate. If you call the UAE several times a month, VoIP technology is a good investment. Some companies sell phone adapters that allow you to place VoIP calls on your regular phone. Use the adapter to place calls through your computer or landline. The disadvantage of VoIP phones is that you need a stable Internet connection. Using a high-speed connection increases the quality of your calls.\n5. Use a legal Internet app if you wish to make quality video calls. In the UAE, the government sets regulations on what apps its citizens can use for phone calls. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) apps are common across the world, and the ones used in the UAE are called Botim and C\u2019me. To use these apps, you need to either be connected to Wi-Fi or use your phone\u2019s mobile network. The person you are calling also needs to have the app installed on their device. Botim and C\u2019me charge a monthly fee to access the app, which can get costly for most residents. On the plus side, these apps offer both regular and video calls. As of 2018, apps like Skype and FaceTime are banned in the UAE. This may change in the near future, but for now, the UAE government wants to steer its citizens away from free services.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to register to vote in ohio?","response":"## Register online\n\n1. Gather documents that prove your identity and address. To register to vote in the state of Ohio, you need to provide various information that proves your identity to the Secretary of State\u2019s office. To that end, gather or look up:\n\t* The last 4 digits of your Social Security number (SSN)\n\t* Your name and date of birth\n\t* Your home address\n\t* Your Ohio driver\u2019s license or other state-issued identification\n2. Navigate to the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s website to begin. Voter registration in Ohio is handled by the Secretary of State\u2019s office. If you have a computer, smartphone, or tablet, it\u2019s quick and easy to register online. Begin at: https:\/\/olvr.sos.state.oh.us\/. Click the link at the bottom of the page that says \u201cLet\u2019s Get Started.\u201d\n\t* You can also register to vote for free at vote.org. The website will send you various notifications about upcoming elections if you register through them. Start the process at: https:\/\/www.vote.org\/register-to-vote\/ohio\/.\n3. Complete the web forms with your personal info and address. As you click through the voter registration web pages, you\u2019ll be asked to confirm your voter eligibility and to provide your name, date of birth, and the number on your Ohio driver\u2019s license. Click \u201cContinue\u201d to move on once you\u2019ve filled out a page. If you realize that you made a mistake on a previous page, you can always click the \u201cBack\u201d button. Avoid clicking on your browser\u2019s back arrow.\n4. Confirm and submit your information to register to vote. The last web page will ask you to review all of the personal information that you\u2019ve provided. Check through everything to make sure you gave accurate information and didn\u2019t include any typos. Once you\u2019ve finished, submit the form to the Secretary of State office. Within 3\u20134 days of submitting the online form, you\u2019ll receive an email informing you that you are registered to vote in Ohio.\n\n\n## Register through the mail\n\n1. Obtain a voter registration form at any public building. In Ohio, it\u2019s easy to obtain a copy of the registration paperwork. Visit any public library, any of the 88 county boards of elections, the office of the Secretary of State, or any public high school. Speak to someone at the main desk or secretarial office and ask for a copy of the voter registration form. If you don\u2019t live near to any public buildings, you can download a PDF copy of the registration form online at: https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/globalassets\/elections\/forms\/vr\\_form\\_04-2015.pdf. You must print the form, though; it cannot be filled out online.\n2. Fill out the entire form in blue or black ink. Provide your name, address, and the last 4 digits of your Social Security number. Write in either your Ohio Driver\u2019s License number or the last 4 digits of your SSN; you don\u2019t need to provide both numbers. Also select your county with the online PDF\u2019s drop-down menu. Sign and date the form once you\u2019ve filled it out. Write as legibly as possible. If the official who receives the form cannot read your handwriting, they won\u2019t be able to register you to vote.\n3. Enclose a copy of your ID if you don\u2019t specify your SSN. If you don\u2019t include either the last 4 digits of your SSN or the number of your Ohio driver\u2019s license, your registration will be incomplete. You can remedy this by including a copy of your current valid photo ID or a copy of your military ID. If you don\u2019t have either of these items, just include a copy of a recent utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, or government check with your name and address on it. Do not send in your actual ID or actual utility bill! The state will not return it.\n4. Mail the completed paperwork to your local county board of elections. If you prefer not to mail your voter registration paperwork, you can deliver the completed form by hand. Just bring it to your home county\u2019s board of elections. Make sure to mail it early enough so the paperwork arrives at least 30 days prior to the next upcoming election to make sure you\u2019re registered in time to vote. If you\u2019re not sure where your local county board of elections is located, you can find out online. Just search for your home county at: https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/elections\/elections-officials\/county-boards-of-elections-directory\/.\n5. Deliver the completed paperwork by hand if you live nearby. If you live close to the county board of elections, or if you prefer not to deliver your voter registration by mail, you can drop off the paperwork in person. Give the form to an administrative assistant or other state employee who handles voter-registration issues. If you\u2019re too busy (or feeling under the weather), ask someone else to drop the registration form off on your behalf.\n\n\n## Change your voter registration information\n\n1. Check your voter registration status online before making changes. Before changing your Ohio voter registration status, it\u2019s a smart idea to check your current voter registration status. You may find that you\u2019re registered at the wrong address or that some other error was made in your personal information. Find out if you\u2019re registered to vote in Ohio at: https:\/\/voterlookup.sos.state.oh.us\/voterlookup.aspx.\n2. Download and print the voter registration PDF. Visit the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s website and download a copy of the voter registration paperwork. This is the same form that you can use to register to vote. However, if you\u2019re changing your registration, you\u2019ll fill out a couple boxes that aren\u2019t used in ordinary registration. Find the form at: https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/globalassets\/elections\/forms\/vr\\_form\\_04-2015.pdf. Or if you prefer, you can visit any government building\u2014including your local county board of elections\u2014and ask for a copy of the registration paperwork. Just make sure that it has a box you can check to indicate that you\u2019re changing your registration and not registering for the first time.\n3. Indicate what\u2019s changed for you and fill out the registration form. With a blue or black ink pen, check the box that says \u201cUpdating my address,\u201d \u201cUpdating my name,\u201d or both boxes, depending on your individual case. Fill out the entire form. If you\u2019re changing your address, include your previous address where indicated. Or, if you\u2019re changing your name, write out your prior name where indicated. Write as neatly as possible so that the person entering your information can read it.\n4. Mail or deliver the form to your local county board of elections. Once you\u2019ve completed the paperwork, stick it in an envelope and mail it to your home county\u2019s board of elections office. Or, if you prefer to deliver it in person, visit the board of elections and give your form to a voter-registration employee. Find your county\u2019s board of elections online at: https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/elections\/elections-officials\/county-boards-of-elections-directory\/. Make sure that the paperwork is at the elections office at least 30 days before the next election so your registration is changed in time for you to vote.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to make your own decorations for halloween?","response":"There are thousands of Halloween decorations you could go out to the store and buy, but often they look generic and plastic-y, don't they? Why not make your own? Using household items, you can make your own ghosts, bats, spiders, and pumpkins! Here's how.\n\n## Ghostly spirit jugs\n\n1. Clean several plastic milk jugs. You don't need to cut them out or in any way modify them -- they just need to be clean. Each one will be one ghost -- how many milk jugs do you need?\n2. Draw a face on the jugs. You can either use a black permanent marker, felt, or any material you have lying around the house. The permanent marker will be the easiest to make a detailed face with. While you do this, only work on the side without the handles and leave the caps on the jugs. The air forced to stay inside by the caps will make it easier to work with, keeping it sturdy. You don't have to go Martha Stewart on this project. Just a circle for a mouth and circles for eyes (leave a little white for the pupils) can be cute, too.\n3. Cut a small hole in the back of the jug. Use a craft knife to cut a hole the size of a half dollar or a bit bigger than a pound coin. Place the hole about 2\/3 of the way up the jug. This won't be seen. If it's not perfect, don't worry about it. Just don't leave any sharp edges!\n4. Stuff the jug with Christmas or fairy lights. You can either use a whole string for one jug, or thread several jugs with a single string. Arrange the jugs together, plug in the cord, and voila! These little buggers work great lining a walk or a patio or table edge. They dim the lighting just enough to glow in a very Halloween-y feel!\n\n\n## Flapping bats\n\n1. Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!) out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it. Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.\n2. Trace your template onto black craft foam. Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!\n3. Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together. Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be). The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.\n4. Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad. Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).\n5. Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop. That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab. This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!\n6. Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes. Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!\n\n\n## Flowerpot pumpkins\n\n1. Purchase a few terra cotta pots. Having a variety of sizes will give you a pumpkin family! Make sure they're clean if you had them laying around the house. You want them very orange to simulate pumpkins.\n2. Cut the parts of a face out of yellow craft paper. If you don't have craft paper, use scrapbook paper, card, or wrapping paper. Anything that's bendy and colorful will work. Make arched evil eyebrows, a handlebar mustache, surprised eyes, or any detail that you'd like your pumpkin pots to have. The simpler your face, the more it will look like a jack-o-lantern. Give it a toothy grin, a triangular nose, and triangular eyes to make it look more pumpkin-esque.\n3. Brush the surface of the pot with outdoor modge-podge. You only need a layer on the side you'll place the face for right now. Use a sponge brush or paint brush for best results. A thin, but even layer is ideal.\n4. Apply the pieces of the face to the upside down pot. Press them firmly into place. Then, apply a thin layer of the sticky stuff all over the pot, effectively weather-proofing it.\n5. Insert a stick into the end for a stem. When we say stick, we mean stick. Go outside under a tree and find a stick to fit through the bottom of your terra cotta pot. And there it is -- a pumpkin that won't rot in a week's time!\n\n\n## Giant spooky spiders\n\n1. Cut off the spout of an empty, clean milk jug. Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with. Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.\n2. Cover the jug with black tape. This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.\n3. Get 4 6-foot (2 m) black foam pipe insulation tubes that are 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug. Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.\n4. Cut a slit at a joint in the legs. If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs. A 1\" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.\n5. Use two halves of a plastic Easter egg for eyes. They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.\n\n\n## Adorable hanging ghosts\n\n1. Create your ghost form with two small paper cups. Turn the first one upside down, then place the second one on top of that. To make it stable, tape or glue the bottoms together. You won't actually be using the cups as part of the ghost -- it's just used for sizing in the initial stages. So if you don't want to fuss with tape, don't worry about it!\n2. Inflate a small balloon and put it in the top cup. But not too much! If it's too big it won't fit in the cup. Make it so it fills out the cup, like a round poof of whipped cream tops a mug of hot chocolate.\n3. Soak pieces of cheesecloth in fabric stiffener. You'll want to work with pieces that are about 8 inches (20 cm) square. Grab a bowl and fill it with fabric stiffener, soaking each piece thoroughly. About 10 seconds per piece will do the job nicely.\n4. Immediately drape over the balloon. After you've soaked a piece, drape it over the balloon and move onto the next piece. Center the pieces, evenly draped over the balloon, but not perfectly uniform. Once you've finished with all your pieces, let it dry for about ten minutes. It will then harden and take shape.\n5. Pop the balloon! This will require a needle or other pointy object since you can't go smashing your creation on the floor (well, you could, if you get really frustrated -- but that'd defeat the purpose). After you do so, you should be left with a free-floating white ghost-like creation. Isn't Halloween the best?\n6. Remove from the cup and rough up the edges. The ends should look tattered, as if they're wafting in some sort of unregisterable-to-humans breeze. Just bending them with your fingers should do the trick.\n7. Attach felt eyes and fishing line to hang. Little tiny black dots for eyes are all these little guys need to be cute and not at all ominous. Black sequins or beads can work, too. As for the fishing line, just thread it through the cheesecloth, loop, and tie in a knot! Hang your new buddies from lights, shelves, windows, or the ceiling.\n\n\n## Eyes in a bush\n\n1. Get an empty toilet paper roll, and a glowstick. You can easily find both at a dollar store.\n2. Cut out two football shaped eye holes. Place them about two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) apart.\n3. Put the glowsticks in the center of the toilet paper roll. Do not cause them to glow until they need to be used as a decoration on the night of Halloween.\n4. Put the roll(s) in your bushes\/trees. When you cause the glowsticks tot work, you will have scary eyes in a bush!\n\n\n## Paper bag ghosts\n\n1. Obtain rubber bands and a white paper bag.\n2. Draw a ghost face on the paper bag.\n3. Put the rubber band around the middle of the bag.\n4. Decorate. Add the face of a ghost and any other designs.\n5. Hang up from the ceiling, on branches, etc.\n\n\n## Scary halloween candy bowl\n\n1. Get a fake hand, a bowl, glue, and candy. The glue must be non-toxic as food is going to come into contact with it.\n2. Glue the fake hand onto the bottom of the bowl.\n3. Let the glue dry for about two to three hours.\n4. Fill the bowl with candy.\n5. Set the bowl out for the trick or treaters.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to prevent an electrical fire during the holidays?","response":"During the holidays, it is common for people to decorate the inside and outside of their home with lighting, and other types of electrical accessories. Although most decorations are manufactured to withstand the holiday season, improper and unsafe usage can increase your chances of experiencing an electrical fire. However, with the proper safety measures, you can prevent electrical fires from occurring, and keep both your home and your family safe. Use this article as your guide for learning how to prevent an electrical fire from occurring during the holiday season.\n\n## General electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Use holiday decorations that have been approved for safety by national laboratories. Decoration packaging will contain seals or labels that indicate the product is safe to use in your home. Using decorations that lack a safety approval may be hazardous, and can trigger an electrical fire.\n2. Inspect the physical condition of all electrical decorations before use. Electrical decorations should not display any loose or frayed wires, loose or cracked bulbs, or any other physical faults. If these features are present, avoid using the decorations to prevent an electrical fire.\n3. Refrain from plugging multiple electrical decorations into one specific outlet. Some outlets cannot support multiple connections, and may become overloaded and trigger an electrical fire as a result. Plug your decorations into multiple outlets, and read the instructions included with your decorations to determine the safest method for use.\n4. Replace bulbs in light strings with those of the same wattage, when applicable. If you replace a bulb with a higher wattage than is required, you can potentially cause the entire string of lights to overheat and start a fire.\n5. Turn off or unplug all electrical decorations when leaving the house or going to sleep. Leaving your decorations unsupervised means that nobody is around to notice any fire that might start. Lights and other electrical components become overheated due to being left on for an extended period of time.\n\n\n## Outdoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Only use lights and electrical decorations that are approved for outdoor use. Outdoor lights and decorations are often manufactured to withstand rain, snow, and other harsh elements. Using decorations that are approved for indoor-use only may trigger an electrical fire when coming into contact with certain elements. Thoroughly read and inspect all decoration packaging to verify that the decorations are safe to use outdoors.\n2. Use a ladder made from wood, fiberglass, or plastic instead of metal. Using a ladder made from materials other than metal will reduce your risk of becoming shocked, or starting an electrical fire.\n3. Keep all extension cords and strings of lights suspended up and away from standing water and snow. If extension cords and wiring come into contact with standing water, they can trigger an electrical fire or cause electrocution.\n4. Place decorations away from major power lines and high-voltage areas. This can prevent electrocution and an electrical fire from starting in the event you accidentally come into contact with a high-voltage power line.\n\n\n## Indoor electrical fire prevention\n\n1. Buy fresh, green trees instead of trees that are dry and losing pine needles. Fresh trees are less flammable and less likely to ignite; whereas dry trees can catch fire when they come into contact with very warm or hot lights. Purchase a fire-resistant or flame-retardant tree if you decide on an artificial tree instead of a live tree.\n2. Place your tree in a position at least 3 feet (0.91 m) (90cm) away from heat sources. Heat sources such as radiators, space heaters, fireplaces, and heat vents can often cause your tree and its electrical decorations to catch fire.\n3. Water your tree on a daily basis or as needed to keep it fresh. By maintaining the freshness of your tree throughout the holiday season, you are reducing the risk of an electrical fire that could be caused by decorations igniting a dry tree.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to join yarn in crocheting?","response":"If you are nearing the end of your ball of yarn or want to change colors, you will need to join the old yarn with a ball of new yarn. There are easy ways to do this! Try a simple knot to help keep the yarn anchored as you work the new yarn, and then weave in the ends later. If you prefer not to weave in any ends, criss-cross and double the yarn or create a no-weave knot to connect the ends.\n\n## Tie a knot and weave in the end\n\n1. Tie a loose knot around the old yarn with a 6 in (15 cm) tail. You can do this anywhere in the row, such as at the beginning, middle, or end. Make the knot tight enough to hold the yarn in place, but also loose enough so that you can easily untie it later. Move the old yarn strand to the side, but do not cut it yet.Tip: Use this method of joining yarn if you want something quick and easy, and you don\u2019t mind weaving in the ends later on.\n2. Crochet with the new yarn leaving the knot in place. To ensure that the yarn is secured seamlessly into your work, begin working the next stitch in your pattern using the new strand of yarn. Do not untie the knot after you work the stitch. For example, if you are doing a single crochet stitch, insert the hook into the next stitch, and yarn over. However, instead of yarning over with your old yarn, yarn over with the new strand. Then, pull this yarn through the stitch, yarn over again, and pull through 2 to complete the stitch.\n3. Cut the old yarn and untie the knot after working a row. After you have crocheted 1 row past where you joined the yarn, untie the knot connecting the new strand to the old strand. Then, cut the old yarn to the same length as the new yarn, if needed. If the old yarn is already the same length as the new yarn, then don\u2019t cut it.\n4. Weave in the ends with a yarn needle. Thread the end of the new yarn through a yarn needle. Then, insert the yarn needle into the stitch nearest its base. Sew all the way through the stitch, and bring the needle back through the next stitch on the other side of the item. Repeat this until you cannot sew any further, then cut the excess yarn about 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the surface of the crocheted item. Repeat the same process to weave in the other strand of yarn.\n\n\n## Cross and double for a no-weave connection\n\n1. Cross the old and new yarn about 3 in (7.6 cm) from their ends. Match up the ends of the new and old yarn. Then, pinch the 2 pieces about 3 in (7.6 cm) from their ends. Twist the pieces around each other 1 time so that they are crossed. Make sure to crochet until you have 6 in (15 cm) left on your current ball of yarn. This will provide enough slack to join the yarn strands.Tip: Try this technique if you don\u2019t want to weave in any ends and you don\u2019t mind doubling up the yarn for a small section.\n2. Cross the strands and hold onto the end of the old strand. Grasp the end of the strand of old yarn and bring it towards the stitch that is currently on the hook. Hold it in place with your thumb. Then, grasp the end of the new yarn and pull it in the opposite direction so that it is doubled over and laying flat. This will allow you to crochet to the very end of the old yarn and pick up the new yarn without any loose ends to weave in later.\n3. Crochet with the doubled over yarn strands. Continue crocheting according to your pattern or stitch. Work the doubled over strands of yarn as you would work a single strand of yarn. Hold the end of the new yarn with your thumb until you have crocheted over this section. Be careful not to pull too hard on either strand of yarn as you crochet this section, or the strand might get disconnected and you will have to start over.\n\n\n## Create a no-weave knot\n\n1. Pinch the new and old yarn 0.25 in (0.64 cm) from the ends. Take the end of your old yarn and the end of your new yarn and line up the ends so that they are even. Then, pinch the ends between your non-dominant thumb and forefinger to hold them in place. Make sure that the ends of the yarn strands are poking out past your fingertips.Tip: Use this option if you want to keep the yarn in a single strand without having any ends to weave in later.\n2. Wrap the new yarn around your thumb 2 times. Use your other hand to grasp the new yarn extending from your forefinger and thumb and wrap it around your thumb and the pinched yarn ends. Make sure that the yarn goes in between your forefinger and thumb as well, but on the outside of the pinched yarn ends. Leave the old yarn alone as you do this. Just let it hang loose and don\u2019t wrap it around anything!\n3. Bring the new yarn back between your thumb and the ends of yarn. After wrapping the yarn around your thumb for the second time, bring the strand back in the opposite direction. Pull it so it goes between your thumb and the 2 ends of yarn instead of around them. Make sure to keep pinching the ends of the yarn as you do this!\n4. Tuck the ends of the yarn down towards your thumb. Use the index finger on your dominant hand to tuck the ends of the 2 strands down over the new yarn. This is the strand that you just pulled between your thumb and the ends. Push the ends down so that they are completely folded over. If you find it hard to tuck the yarn down with your finger, use your crochet hook to tuck it down.\n5. Pull gently on the new yarn and allow the loops to slip off your thumb. Continue to pinch the yarn between your finger and thumb, and use your other hand to start tugging gently on the new yarn. Tug until the first loop tightens and slips off your thumb, and then keep pulling to tighten the other 2 loops into a knot around the end of the old yarn. The ends of the yarn should be joined in a tight knot after you pull off the last loop. You can continue crocheting as you normally would once the ends are joined!\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You may be nearing the end of your ball of yarn.","max_prob":20.2532997131,"ccp":-0.0489222658},{"claim":"You may want to change colors.","max_prob":5.6884875298,"ccp":-0.1287598451},{"claim":"You will need to join the old yarn with a ball of new yarn if you are nearing the end of your ball of yarn.","max_prob":52.9640541077,"ccp":-0.0000058301},{"claim":"You can criss-cross and double the yarn to connect the ends.","max_prob":33.6947593689,"ccp":-0.0015830268},{"claim":"You can create a no-weave knot to connect the ends.","max_prob":29.0408744812,"ccp":-0.000016388},{"claim":"You may prefer not to weave in any ends.","max_prob":12.8486146927,"ccp":-0.0868924868},{"claim":"There is an old yarn.","max_prob":2.631714344,"ccp":-0.6882989608},{"claim":"A loose knot is tied around the old yarn.","max_prob":12.7295417786,"ccp":-0.2166725185},{"claim":"The knot has a 6 inch (15 cm) tail.","max_prob":11.9063415527,"ccp":-0.2063797745},{"claim":"You can do this anywhere in the row.","max_prob":11.6270923615,"ccp":-0.8942277336},{"claim":"You can do this in the middle of the row.","max_prob":8.5231924057,"ccp":-0.2912842659},{"claim":"There is a method of joining yarn.","max_prob":6.2102966309,"ccp":-0.7089866296},{"claim":"The method of joining yarn is quick.","max_prob":8.1613445282,"ccp":-0.7089866296},{"claim":"The method of joining yarn is easy.","max_prob":6.5531358719,"ccp":-0.6879008575},{"claim":"Using this method requires weaving in the ends later on.","max_prob":10.3440666199,"ccp":-0.5627102955},{"claim":"The yarn needs to be secured seamlessly into your work.","max_prob":23.8383178711,"ccp":-0.1692173629},{"claim":"You should begin working the next stitch in your pattern.","max_prob":16.7527618408,"ccp":-0.3175133144},{"claim":"You should use the new strand of yarn to work the next stitch.","max_prob":19.0130825043,"ccp":-0.2940313901},{"claim":"You have crocheted 1 row past where you joined the yarn.","max_prob":18.4703979492,"ccp":-0.2985604773},{"claim":"There is a knot connecting the new strand to the old strand.","max_prob":14.466588974,"ccp":-0.1323066915},{"claim":"You should untie the knot connecting the new strand to the old strand.","max_prob":18.2663421631,"ccp":-0.0158063114},{"claim":"You should repeat the sewing process until you cannot sew any further.","max_prob":12.7428312302,"ccp":-0.0000912773},{"claim":"You should cut the excess yarn about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from the surface of the crocheted item.","max_prob":24.1876373291,"ccp":-0.0061724949},{"claim":"You should grasp the end of the new yarn.","max_prob":4.3456220627,"ccp":-0.580528121},{"claim":"You should pull the end of the new yarn in the opposite direction.","max_prob":11.1436948776,"ccp":-0.3864655613},{"claim":"The new yarn should be doubled over.","max_prob":9.3326148987,"ccp":-0.9155974787},{"claim":"The new yarn should be laying flat.","max_prob":8.2353887558,"ccp":-0.4591374099},{"claim":"You can crochet to the very end of the old yarn.","max_prob":16.1121177673,"ccp":-0.2132686064},{"claim":"You can pick up the new yarn.","max_prob":6.3295097351,"ccp":-0.0356680975},{"claim":"There will be no loose ends to weave in later.","max_prob":12.1076936722,"ccp":-0.1055867093},{"claim":"There is a new yarn.","max_prob":3.2561509609,"ccp":-0.0641506859},{"claim":"There is an old yarn.","max_prob":0.0894722641,"ccp":-0.9947904003},{"claim":"The new yarn has an end.","max_prob":4.1241879463,"ccp":-0.0620594511},{"claim":"The old yarn has an end.","max_prob":1.3070049286,"ccp":-0.972378658},{"claim":"The new yarn and old yarn should be pinched 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) from their ends.","max_prob":13.90229702,"ccp":-0.0001752826},{"claim":"The yarn strands have ends.","max_prob":7.3149232864,"ccp":-0.7586874039},{"claim":"The ends of the yarn strands should poke out.","max_prob":15.9680223465,"ccp":-0.173878229},{"claim":"The ends of the yarn strands should poke out past your fingertips.","max_prob":23.3141746521,"ccp":-0.273756268},{"claim":"You have new yarn.","max_prob":3.4165666103,"ccp":-0.1795666413},{"claim":"You wrap the new yarn around your thumb.","max_prob":8.6705780029,"ccp":-0.1215173684},{"claim":"You wrap the new yarn around your thumb 2 times.","max_prob":10.4519081116,"ccp":-0.0274451981},{"claim":"You may find it hard to tuck the yarn down with your finger.","max_prob":16.7307491302,"ccp":-0.2449947262},{"claim":"You are pinching the yarn between your finger and thumb.","max_prob":13.9356527328,"ccp":-0.5335264254},{"claim":"You are using your other hand.","max_prob":3.4484093189,"ccp":-0.5145429638},{"claim":"You are tugging gently on the new yarn.","max_prob":6.4915904999,"ccp":-0.9907740705}]}
{"instruction":"How to speak english?","response":"English is a language which is spoken all around the world, and learning to speak it can help you meet new people and advance your career. Learning to speak English can be hard, but with practice and patience, you can become fluent in your new language.\n\n## Get the basics down\n\n1. Start simple. Very few people are true beginners when it comes to English. \"Hello,\" \"hi,\" \"How are you?\" and numerals have infiltrated most societies. Odds are you know more English than you think. Take what you know. For example, \"How are you?\" That uses the verb \"to be.\" What are other questions just like this? Take what you know and expand it! How is she?How is your father?How are your children?How is the weather? Start memorizing verbs. The top ten most common verbs in English are the following: \"be,\" \"have,\" \"do,\" \"say,\" \"get,\" \"make,\" \"go,\" \"know,\" \"take,\" and \"see.\" Just knowing these verbs can get you through a lot of basic conversations. English is subject-verb-object, in that order. Your subject pronouns are: \"I,\" \"you,\" \"he\"\/\"she\"\/\"it,\" \"we,\" \"you,\" \"they.\" Object pronouns in English are: \"me,\" \"you,\" \"him\"\/\"her\"\/\"it,\" \"us,\" \"you,\" \"them.\" With those verbs and knowing English is SVO, what sentences can you come up with? I know her.She makes it.He takes us.\n2. Practice conversations. Once you have basic subject and object pronouns down and a handful of verbs, you can start asking questions. Questions often open with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" and \"how.\" \"Who\" indicates a person; \"what\" indicates a thing; \"when\" indicates a time; \"where\" indicates a place; \"why\" indicates a reason; \"how\" indicates a manner. Say you know the subjects, some basic nouns, those ten verbs, and these question starters. What are some things you could ask an English speaker? What is your name?What do you do?When is your birthday?Where is she?Why do you have it?How do you know?\n\n\n## Get familiar with the grammar\n\n1. Start with the present tenses. Let's start with present simple and present continuous:\n\t* Present simple is used for facts and habits. If you are describing something that is true or something that happens often, opt for the present simple. I go to work every day.She eats breakfast at 7.China is a big country. Present continuous is used for things that are happening right now. There are two verbs: a helper and a main verb. The helper is \"am\"\/\"is\"\/\"are\" (depending on the subject) and the main verb is any verb with -ing:\n\t* You are reading.I am typing.He is watching TV.\n2. Move to the past and future tenses. Once you've mastered the present, get started on the past and future tenses. We're just going to go over the basic ones now:\n\t* Use the past simple for any event that happened in the past at a specific time. I saw that movie last year.She died on a plane.We went to the bank yesterday. For the future, let's keep it simple. Add a future time marker, and just use the present continuous! It can double as a future tense, too. They are making a cake tomorrow.You are leaving in May.I am going at 6 pm.\n3. Put your adjectives before nouns. Always, always, always put the adjective (the word that describes) before the noun. Always! In fact, there's even an order within adjectives:\n\t* There are eight basic types of adjectives: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more than one, they go in that order. So, it's a \"huge, round, metal bowl\" or a \"small, red sleeping bag.\"\n\n\n## Maintain progress\n\n1. Label everything. Take the objects in your house and label them with their English equivalent. The goal is to get your mind thinking in English. When it's right there, it'll be impossible to ignore. When you've labeled everything and find yourself thinking, \"Where is my blanket?\" try to think of the word (or sentence) in English. When you find your blanket, were you right? Don't write on the objects--grab a slip of paper and tape it on sturdily.\n2. Keep an eye on your pronunciation. It's very easy to get caught up in memorizing words when pronunciation can be just as important. Unfortunately, English has exceptions to most rules. But there are still some general guidelines you can abide by:\n\t* Always say the last sounds in the word. Certain Asian dialects find this rather difficult. If you know you're guilty of this, keep it in mind. \"Streets\" is not pronounced stree. The \"ts\" is very important in retaining meaning. Take the sentence \"I project the project will end soon.\" Confusing, huh? Isn't English SVO? Yes, and this sentence is too. The first \"project\" (verb) is pronounced pro-JECT; the second (noun) is pronounced PRO-ject. The same is true for all verb-noun pairs: nouns stress the first syllable, verbs the second. Though there are definite exceptions, most nouns in English have the first syllable stressed. Think of the nouns in your house: \"BED-room,\" \"BATH-room,\" \"KITCH-en,\" \"TA-ble,\" \"WIN-dow,\" \"SO-fa,\" \"WA-ter,\" \"JACK-et,\" \"TOI-let,\" etc.\n3. Pick a dialect. There are meaningful differences between American, British, and Australian English. Before you go about increasing your vocabulary, which one appeals to you? Sometimes it's very important to know who you're speaking to. If you tell an American, Canadian, or Australian you're not wearing pants, they might wonder if you're wearing shorts, a dress, a skirt, or just in your underwear. If you tell a British person you're not wearing pants, you're going commando! In addition to vocabulary differences, the pronunciation differences are huge. Know these variations exist before you get confused with multiple correct pronunciations. Certain dictionaries use British English and certain dictionaries prefer American. Choose the one that's best for you.\n\n\n## Use your resources\n\n1. Get a good dictionary. If you need to, get several. A dictionary to translate between your first language and English is best, in addition to a dictionary in English only. Get a pocket-sized version for when you're on the go and that pesky word you keep forgetting comes up.\n2. Speak in English with native speakers. Though it may be tempting to speak with your other friends who are learning too, you'll see the quickest results if you converse mainly with native speakers. Hire a tutor or private teacher. Make sure they're native and have the accent you want. Choose someone with teaching experience--just because you can speak a language does not mean you can teach it. If a teacher isn't up your alley, get a penpal!\n3. Use the internet. There are literally hundreds upon hundreds of sites you can use to your benefit. Anything to make grammar more exciting is welcome--there are games and videos galore. Such resources can be found at Simple English Wikipedia, the British Council, and English Club, among many others. YouTube doesn't have to be about funny animals and popular music. Tap into its educational resources as well.\n4. Watch TV, listen to songs, and read books. Though your goal is to speak English, you have to be able to understand it, too! Even when you're alone and not stuck in a grammar exercise you can keep your mind primed. Start with children's books and TV shows. The language is simpler and will go slower. Eventually, move to channels catered to your interests. If you enjoy cooking, graduate to the Food Network and see what you can pick up on. Try not to turn on the captions! If you have a DVR, record the shows. That way you can go back and work through the dialogue and conversations at your own pace. Listen to English music! Ballads go quite slowly and the refrains can be rather repetitive. Your vocabulary will naturally expand, too.\n5. Think in English. If you find yourself thinking something simple in you native tongue, what would its equivalent be in English? Make a habit of this for maintenance and memory. Think out loud if helps. Explain to your roommates or family what you're trying to do; maybe they'll want to catch on, too! Eventually, simple phrases will become par for the course.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"English is a

{"instruction":"How to make a model water tower?","response":"Water towers are large, elevated tanks of water that are essential for the distribution of clean water to many communities across the globe. Not only do they come in many different shapes and sizes, but it\u2019s intriguing to learn about the way water towers work. Whether you need a model water tower for a train set or school project, or you simply want to learn about the way they work, you can easily build your own model with the right materials and know-how.\n\n## Create a function model water tower\n\n1. Locate a small plastic bottle and a large plastic bottle. The small water bottle can be a standard-sized Coke, juice, or water bottle, as long as it has a screw-on cap. The large bottle should be a 2-liter soda bottle, jug, or a large juice bottle. Test the size of your bottles by placing the small bottle upside-down, with its neck sticking into the opening on the large bottle. The small bottle should sit comfortably on top of the large one. If it does not, you will need to find different bottles. The bottles must be plastic, as you will need to cut them.\n2. Remove the cap from the small bottle and cut a hole in the middle of it. Use scissors to punch a hole into the center of the cap, then widen the hole until it\u2019s slightly smaller than the circumference of the holes at both ends of the tubing. Water will leak out of the hole if it\u2019s too big, but it will still need to be big enough to push the tubing into it. It\u2019s better to have a hole that\u2019s too small than a hole that\u2019s too big, as you can always use your scissors to widen it if necessary.\n3. Punch a pin-sized hole in the bottom of the small water bottle. Use a pin, needle, earring, or any other device that will create an almost invisible hole. This will allow the bottle to vent when the water starts flowing.\n4. Cut a medium-sized hole in the side of the large bottle. Make the hole big enough that the cap and tubing can both fit through it. You can put the hole anywhere on the bottle that you choose, but roughly halfway down the bottle is a good option. Unlike the small bottle, you don\u2019t have to worry about leaks if this hole isn\u2019t the right size. This hole can be large or small just as long as the cap and tubing will fit through it comfortably.\n5. Feed 1 end of the tubing through the hole in the large bottle. Push the tubing through the large hole and out through the top of the large bottle. Lay the large bottle on its side with the hole you cut facing upward for easier access.\n6. Squeeze the same end of the tubing into the hole you cut in the cap. Feed roughly 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of tubing in through the cap. Clamp the binder clip roughly 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the other side of the tubing. Put the side of the tubing with the binder clip into a bowl that will catch the water. If your hole on the cap is the right size, you will have to forcefully push the tubing into the hole. It should fit snugly in the hole without slipping.\n7. Fill the small bottle with water. Once the bottle is full, place the cap with the tubing through it on top of the bottle. Feed the tubing into the water, then screw the cap on tightly. Hold your finger over the pin-sized hole on the bottom of the bottle to keep water from leaking out.\n8. Place the small bottle upside-down in the top opening on the large bottle. The neck of the small bottle should fit all the way into the opening on the large bottle. You now have a functioning model water tower! The water should flow into the tubing once you flip it upside down, but the binder clip will stop the flow. Experiment by releasing the clip at different heights to see where the water stops flowing.\n\n\n## Build a model water tower with popsicle stick\n\n1. Cut the rounded ends off of roughly 70 Popsicle sticks. Barely snip both ends of each Popsicle stick to make the ends straight on both sides. Make them all as close to the same size as possible. To cut the sticks evenly, line up the second stick with the first stick you cut. Use the first Popsicle stick as reference for where to cut the second stick. Do the same thing for the third, the fourth, and so on, until all 70 Popsicle sticks are the same size.\n2. Snip 2 of the cut Popsicle sticks in half. You don\u2019t have to measure them, but cut them as close to the center as possible. You will now have 4 smaller pieces of Popsicle stick that are roughly half the length of the other Popsicle sticks.\n3. Apply glue to 1 end of 1 of the small stick sections. Connect the edge of a second small stick to the area where you just applied glue. Then, apply glue to the end of the second piece that is not connected. Glue the edge of a third small section to the open second section. Repeat this process for the fourth section, then apply glue to connect the edge of the fourth section to the open edge of the first section you glued. You will now have a square frame made out of the 4 smaller Popsicle pieces. Your frame doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly square. In fact, if you\u2019re going for a rustic look, an imperfect square may even be ideal. If you\u2019re using super glue, you can apply glue to all 4 edges before connecting them all together. If you\u2019re using hot glue, make sure to glue each edge separately. This will keep the glue from drying before you can connect all 4 sections together.\n4. Line up 2 larger Popsicle sticks to create 1 long, straight stick. Place the sticks on a flat surface with their ends touching. Take another Popsicle stick of the same size and apply glue to the entire surface on 1 side, lengthwise. Place the glued side directly in the middle of the 2 sticks that are lined up. The third stick does not have to be exactly in the middle of the other 2 sticks, but it should be close enough that it holds the other 2 sticks together evenly.\n5. Repeat this process 3 more times. Follow the same process as before by lining up 2 of the larger Popsicle sticks and gluing a third stick on top of them. Do this 3 more times until you have 4 identical long sections that are each made out of 3 glued Popsicle sticks.\n6. Connect the end of 1 of the long sticks to the inside corner of the square frame. Apply glue to the inside edge of the long stick and place it at a slight outward angle, with the third stick that is holding the other 2 sticks together facing inward. Glue the long stick so that it does not poke out above the frame once connected. Do the same thing with the other 3 long sections you created in the other 3 corners of the frame. This will form the legs of the water tower, so make the angle as identical as possible for each of the long sticks. Keep the angle of the legs around 10-15 degrees. If the angle is too steep, the water tower will be too short. If it is too steep, it will probably topple over.\n7. Use another Popsicle stick to connect 2 of the legs together. Apply glue to each inside edge of the stick. Place the edges of the Popsicle stick on top of the lines where the 2 Popsicle sticks used to create the legs meet. Do the same thing with 3 other sticks until you have a stick connecting the legs on all 4 sides. You will need to spread the legs apart so that the sticks do not hang outside the edge of the leg. Keep the connecting sticks as level as possible. You want it to appear as if there is a single, continuous stick wrapping around the legs of the tower, not 4 separate small sticks.\n8. Lay 9 Popsicle sticks side-by-side on a flat surface. Line them up along their long edges so the sticks make a square when lined up. Apply a line of glue on the edge of the square down the length of all 9 Popsicle sticks. Place another Popsicle stick along the same direction as the glue line so that it holds all 9 sticks together. Do the same thing with another line of glue and another Popsicle stick on the other end of the square. The Popsicle sticks used to hold the other 9 sticks together should be the same length as the square, so that they match up perfectly with both corners and do not hang over the edge. You may need to trim the sticks down or remove one of the 9 sticks to match up the lengths. Use your hand to hold the Popsicle stick square together as you glue it. Place your hand flat on top of all 9 sticks, and do your best to keep them all together with no gaps between them.\n9. Apply glue to the top edge of the square frame you made earlier. Place the square platform you just created on top of the frame, connecting it to the base structure you already made. Glue the platform so that the Popsicle sticks used to connect the other sticks together are facing downward. You can also glue each individual Popsicle stick directly onto the square frame you made earlier. It will take longer, but you may be able to line the sticks up better this way.\n10. Cut the rim off of a small paper Dixie cup. Cut around the top of the open side to remove the outer rim. Try to keep the line as straight as possible, since this will form the foundation for the water container part of your water tower.\n11. Glue the remaining Popsicle sticks to the outside of the Dixie cup. Place glue along one of the wide edges of a Popsicle stick. Line up the top edge of the stick with the bottom edge of the cup and glue it down. Repeat this process around the entire circumference of the cup until it is completely covered. When gluing the sticks onto the cup, fan them out from one another to create a more realistic look. When you place the second stick on the cup, keep the edge of the stick as close to the edge of the cup as possible, but fan out the end that is jutting over the edge of the cup by about 5 degrees so that a small sliver of the cup can be seen underneath. Roughly half of the length of each Popsicle stick will be glued to the Dixie cup, while the other half will be jutting out over the rim of the cup.\n12. Cover the gaps in the Popsicle sticks by gluing another layer on top. If you fanned out the sticks to create a more realistic look, go back over the cup with additional Popsicle sticks. Glue the sticks directly in the middle of two sticks on the bottom layer so that the second layer covers up any slivers of cup that may be showing. Keep the edges lined up with the bottom edge of the cup as best you can.\n13. Place the Dixie cup in the middle of the platform with the open side up. Apply glue around the entire circumference of the bottom of the cup. Then, stick it down as close to the middle of the platform as possible. Use a lot of glue to attach the Dixie cup so that it doesn\u2019t fall off if it\u2019s bumped. Optionally, you can wrap a string around the bottom and middle of the Dixie cup to give it a Western look. Wrap the string several times for better results.\n14. Use 2 wooden dowels to create a ladder. Place 2 wooden dowels roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a flat surface. Line them up so they are parallel with the pointy side on top. Use small sections of Popsicle sticks roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) long to create the steps. Apply glue to both ends of 1 side of the stick, then place it horizontally between the dowels so that it connects them together. Do this all the way up the 2 dowels, roughly 7 times, until about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointy side of the dowels is left sticking out.\n15. Lean the ladder against the water tower at an angle and secure it with glue. Glue another small section of Popsicle stick horizontally across the very tips of the dowels, above and on the opposite side of the steps. Lean it up against the side of your water tower with the tips facing up. Place glue on the backside of the tips of the dowel and press down to attach it.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to become hot?","response":"Being hot is more than just a look\u2014it's a frame of mind. Whether you're just walking down the street or stopping to have a quick conversation, if you hold yourself in  confidence then everyone in your orbit will be thinking you're hot in no time. But what if you're not sure if you can be the sexy, intriguing, and hot person that you want to be?\n\n## Think hot\n\n1. Allow yourself to want to be hot. Maybe you want to look like a hot guy or girl, but you're afraid you\u2019ll be judged or looked down on. For some, wanting to be hot has negative connotations of someone being too vain or shallow. Don\u2019t let these stereotypes and misconceptions stop you from achieving hotness. Give yourself permission to become hot. Being hot should be something you want and not something you feel pressured to be. Today\u2019s society puts a lot of importance in looking attractive in a certain way, but it\u2019s not necessarily the only way to be attractive\n2. Exude self-confidence. In order to be hot, you have to believe you\u2019re hot. Have confidence in your decisions, in the way you look, and in who you are or want to be. It will also help you bounce back from setbacks and accepting difficult challenges that come your way. Remind yourself of what you\u2019ve already achieved and enjoy these successes. Don\u2019t forget how much you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you\u2019ve reached in the process of trying to reach a new one. Don\u2019t put too much importance on how others perceive you. If looking hot makes you feel happy, then that\u2019s more important than what others might think.\n3. Have realistic body image goals. You don\u2019t have to look like a model. You should be the shape you're happy with. Half of that means changing your body through exercise and eating healthy, but the other half is accepting your body's own uniqueness. It's understandable to want to reach a healthy weight level, but it's not realistic to achieve a tiny waist if you're naturally top-heavy or try to make your butt bigger if it's naturally petite. Don't ignore your own assets in the process of trying to mimic someone else's. Avoid labelling a certain body type as the \u201cperfect\u201d body. There are many kinds of bodies that are beautiful in their own way.\n\n\n## Dress hot\n\n1. Figure out what body shape you have and dress to flatter it (for women). A great outfit should accentuate your best features and minimize unflattering parts of your body. Here are some ways to dress some common body types:\n\t* \n\t* Apple or circle shaped: Counter the roundness and softness of your body by adding structure to your outfit, especially on top. Wear a fitted blazer or wrap dresses that create asymmetrical lines across your body. Straight-legged pants help elongate your legs and draw attention to your body vertically. Large prints and patterns will flatter you better than small prints, especially if worn on top. Avoid covering yourself up with large or loose shirts \u2013 instead, wear more form fitted items or clothes drape down your body. Pear or triangle shaped: Balance out your great hips by creating layers on top. A cardigan or a jacket cropped at the waist helps even out your slender top half with your curves at the bottom. Show off those great shoulders by wearing one-shouldered shirts or shirts with embellished collars. Boot-cut or slightly flared pants paired with high heels will elongate your legs. Hourglass shaped: You\u2019ve got the shape everyone is looking for! To better show off those sought-after curves, dress simple. Items in solid colours with cinched waists show off your small stomach. Avoid prints that take away the spotlight from your silhouette. Athletic or ruler shaped: Your slender body can sometimes look too boxy so avoid stripes or cropped shirts. Try fitted tank tops with smaller straps, or halter-tops that enhance the look of your bust. High-waist pants and skirts give the illusion of that hourglass shape. Stick with soft fabrics that flow off your body to counter the hard lines of your athletic build.\n2. Invest in clothes tailored for your body (for men). Learn what fit suits your body best or go to a tailor to have your clothes fitted for you. There\u2019s nothing worse than wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight in all the wrong places. Shoulders: The seam where the sleeve attaches to the body should rest on top of your shoulders. They should not hang down onto your arms. Arms: The fabric under your armpits should be tapered to your skin but still allow motion for your arms. Chest: Your chest should fill out the front of your shirt so that its shape can be seen through the fabric. You should also have a full range of motion in your arms. Try reaching up, back, and forward. If you can\u2019t do those things, then your shirt is too tight. Buttons that looked pulled and cause wrinkles are another tell tale sign that your shirt is too tight. Sleeves: If you\u2019re wearing long sleeves, the cuff of your shirt should stop just at the base of your thumb. Pants: If you\u2019re opting for a slim-cut or skinny pant, make sure there is a straight cut from your knees to your ankles. The cuff of your pants should never create flaps or pool at your feet. They should stop just at the ankles or little past your shoes. Belts: They should really only be a way to accessorize and should not actually be holding up your pants. If a belt is the only thing keeping your pants on, then they\u2019re probably too big. Shoes: Many stylists claim shoes are the foundation of men\u2019s looks. An outfit is dependent on the colour and type of shoe you're wearing. So dress from the shoes up.\n3. Polish your look by matching simple colours with bold statement pieces. Solid coloured clothing items make statement pieces pop. Choose statement pieces like large earrings, patterned shoes, a colourful bag, or a fancy hat. Black is always hot and matches with almost anything. An all black outfit gives you a clean look but also gives you a little edge and mystery. Use the power of contrast to your advantage. Darker coloured clothing can help you achieve a more slender look or mask unappealing features. While patterns or light coloured items can highlight areas of your body you\u2019d like to show off.\n4. Follow fashion trends. Fashion is always changing so keep up with the latest trends to stay hot. Although, not every trend is worth following or is flattering on everyone so pick what will look good on you and what fits with your style. Avoid age-inappropriate fashion trends. Being hot doesn't mean looking younger or more mature.\n5. Show off a little skin or wear a form-hugging outfit. A bit of sexiness can go a long way when you want to look hot. However, make sure it\u2019s an appropriate amount of skin. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re being too revealing when:\n\t* It gets in the way of forming meaningful relationships. We live in a sex-fuelled society, so it\u2019s not surprising when people can\u2019t help but look at bare skin. It can make people perceive you differently or draw focus away from what you have to offer and more towards what you look like to them. If this type of attention is not what you want, then it\u2019s not the right moment to show off too much skin. It prevents you from furthering your career or getting hired. In most work environments, showing off too much skin is discouraged. You receive negative or dangerous attention. It\u2019s difficult for many people, especially women, to show off skin without attracting negative attention. And since you can\u2019t control other people\u2019s reactions and actions, your safety and comfort should always come first.\n\n\n## Look hot\n\n1. Radiate confident body language. It's not always enough to just dress the part, but you have to appear hot. And a few tricks to improve your body language can help:\n\t* Stand tall and with purpose. Stick your chest out and keep your hands from fidgeting. The power position is often described with the image of Superman with his hands at his hips, chin high, and legs apart. Move steadily with your actions. Talking too fast or doing things in a hurry shows that you're nervous or anxious. Have a variety of expressions on your face and body. Confident people are able to express themselves naturally but won't overdo it. This makes you more approachable and open.\n2. Get in shape. Whether you want to achieve a certain body weight goal, or just become more physically healthy, getting in shape is a great step towards becoming hot. Invest in a gym membership or a personal trainer. With a trainer\u2019s guided advice and encouragement, you can start to work on areas of your body and achieve weight goals in a safe and effective way. Eat healthy. Cut down on junk foods and start eating a better balanced diet. Exercising and eating well will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and improve your overall mental health as well.\n3. Have good posture. Improving your posture not only makes you look more confident, but also has many health benefits. Fixing your posture can reduce head and back pain, inflexibility, and prevent compromised muscles. Assess your posture so you can work on your body\u2019s problem areas. Generally, your shoulders should be balanced and one shouldn\u2019t appear higher than the other. They should also be aligned with your ear so your neck and head aren\u2019t jutting forward. Your back should not be rounded and your arms should relax at your sides. Do posture-improving exercises everyday. They can be simple exercises like straightening your back while sitting, walking more, or stretching out those kinks. Or they can be more complicated exercises that stretch and form your back to the correct posture. Be conscious of how you hold yourself. It\u2019s easy to start slumping forward when you\u2019re working at your desk or sitting down and relaxing. Make an effort to sit in the correct position with your back straight, arms back, and head and neck aligned with your shoulders.\n4. Choose a trendy haircut that compliments your look and face shape. Try dyeing your hair, cutting it extremely short or getting extensions to mix it up every once in a while and give off a dynamic appearance. Take care of your hair. The simplest thing you can do is wash your hair and condition it. Invest in hair products or natural remedies to fight problems such as frizzy, dry, or greasy hair. Get a haircut every month or two to avoid split ends and the unkempt look.\n5. Develop a skin care routine. Your skin is the foundation of your look. Keep it clean and clear of blemishes and other problem factors by treating and protecting it. Try out different products to make sure they\u2019re right for your skin. Wear sunscreen. It\u2019s the easiest thing to forget but a little sunscreen every day can prevent wrinkles and skin discoloration. Moisturize your skin. Use lotion, cream, or body butter for your hands, arms, legs, and face. Lip balm helps with chapped or cracking lips. For oily skin, use oil-free products to cleanse your face. For acne prone skin, avoid touching your face or popping your pimples. Instead, wash your face with an acne cleanser or warm water and hypoallergenic soap and keep your skin well moisturized. Acne develops when oils, either from your fingers or overactive hormones and glands, mix together with dirt to clog up your pores.\n\n\n## Act hot\n\n1. Show your cool side. Ironically, being hot means being cool. It\u2019s a likeable quality to have that attracts people to you because of your laid back demeanour. A few cool things to do:\n\t* Don\u2019t try so hard. Or at least look like you\u2019re not trying so hard. It gives the impression that you\u2019re so smooth, you can get want you want without even trying. If you fidget a lot, bite your lip, stumble in your speech or am just generally nervous, try feeling cool. It\u2019s hard to monitor or stop the nervous little ticks our body does when we're nervous so the best way to go about it is from the inside out. Feel cool and your body language will follow. Be a little rebellious. Sometimes a little rule breaking or risk-taking is very cool and makes you appear powerful. But don't do anything illegal!\n2. Play up your sex appeal. There are many ways to be sexy and look sexy. Try:\n\t* Wearing red. There have been numerous studies that the colour red is the sexiest colour. Something in our human brains are highly attracted to the colour. Smiling. Looking happy and approachable is very sexy. So flash does pearly whites! Making strong eye contact. This is a highly confident move that draws people in. Pair it up with a smile or flirtatious look to amp up the sexiness. Flirting. It\u2019s a sexy and fun way to communicate with someone you\u2019re interested in. Subtly draw attention to your body or tease your target with flirtatious looks or bold compliments.\n3. Be humble. The worst thing you can do is brag about how hot you are. Modesty and being gracious to others are attractive qualities. The most confident people are those who are able to build others up. Give compliments. If you want to attract someone\u2019s attention, pay them a genuine compliment. Don\u2019t brag and look down on others. The attention that comes with being hot can easily develop into a large ego. Your friends, family and other people will be turned off by someone who constantly needs to prove they\u2019re hot or thinks too highly of themselves.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to determine gear ratio?","response":"In mechanical engineering, a gear ratio is a direct measure of the ratio of the rotational speeds of two or more interlocking gears. As a general rule, when dealing with two gears, if the drive gear (the one directly receiving rotational force from the engine, motor, etc.) is bigger than the driven gear, the latter will turn more quickly, and vice versa. We can express this basic concept with the formula Gear ratio = T2\/T1, where T1 is the number of teeth on the first gear and T2 is the number of teeth on the second.\n\n## Find the gear ratio of a gear train\n\n1. Start with a two-gear train. To be able to determine a gear ratio, you must have at least two gears engaged with each other \u2014 this is called a \"gear train.\" Usually, the first gear is a \"drive gear\" attached to the motor shaft and the second is a \"driven gear\" attached to the load shaft. There may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear: these are called \"idler gears.\" For now, let's look at a gear train with only two gears in it. To be able to find a gear ratio, these gears have to be interacting with each other \u2014 in other words, their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other. For example purposes, let's say that you have one small drive gear (gear 1) turning a larger driven gear (gear 2).\n2. Count the number of teeth on the drive gear. One simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth (the little peg-like protrusions at the edge of the wheel) that they both have. Start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear. You can do this by counting manually or, sometimes, by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself. For example purposes, let's say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth.\n3. Count the number of teeth on the driven gear. Next, determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear. Let's say that, in our example, the driven gear has 30 teeth.\n4. Divide one teeth count by the other. Now that you know how many teeth are on each gear, you can find the gear ratio relatively simply. Divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth. Depending on your assignment, you may write your answer as a decimal, a fraction, or in ratio form (i.e., x : y). In our example, dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30\/20 = 1.5. We can also write this as 3\/2 or 1.5 : 1, etc. What this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn. This makes sense \u2014 since the driven gear is bigger, it will turn more slowly.\n5. Start with a gear train of more than two gears. As its name suggests, a \"gear train\" can also be made from a long sequence of gears \u2014 not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear. In these cases, the first gear remains the driver gear, the last gear remains the driven gear, and the ones in the middle become \"idler gears.\" These are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available. Let's say for example purposes that the two-gear train described above is now driven by a small seven-toothed gear. In this case, the 30-toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20-toothed gear (which was the driver before) is now an idler gear.\n6. Divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears. The important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears (usually the first and last ones) matter. In other words, the idler gears don't affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all. When you've identified your driver gear and your driven gear, you can find the gear ratio exactly as before. In our example, we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver. 30\/7 = about 4.3 (or 4.3 : 1, etc.) This means that the driver gear has to turn about 4.3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once.\n7. If desired, find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears. You can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well, and you may want to in certain situations. In these cases, start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear. Treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned. Divide the number of teeth on each \"driven\" gear by the number of teeth on the \"drive\" gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios. In our example, the intermediate gear ratios are 20\/7 = 2.9 and 30\/20 = 1.5. Note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train, 4.3. However, note also that (20\/7) \u00d7 (30\/20) = 4.3. In general, the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio.\n\n\n## Make ratio\\\/speed calculations\n\n1. Find the rotational speed of your drive gear. Using the idea of gear ratios, it's easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the \"input\" speed of the drive gear. To start, find the rotational speed of your drive gear. In most gear calculations, this is given in rotations per minute (rpm), though other units of velocity will also work. For example, let's say that in the example gear train above with a seven-toothed driver gear and a 30-toothed driven gear, the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms. With this information, we'll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps.\n2. Plug your information into the formula S1 \u00d7 T1 = S2 \u00d7 T2. In this formula, S1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear, T1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear, and S2 and T2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear. Fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined. Often, in these sorts of problems, you'll be solving for S2, though it's perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables. In our example, plugging in the information we have, we get this:\n\t* 130 rpms \u00d7 7 = S2 \u00d7 30\n3. Solve. Finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra. Just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer. Don't forget to label it with the correct units \u2014 you can lose points for this in schoolwork. In our example, we can solve like this:\n\t* 130 rpms \u00d7 7 = S2 \u00d7 30\n\t* 910 = S2 \u00d7 30\n\t* 910\/30 = S2\n\t* \n\t* 30.33 rpms = S2\n\t* In other words, if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms, the driven gear will spin at 30.33 rpms. This makes sense \u2014 since the driven gear is much bigger, it will spin much slower.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Math","claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"A gear ratio is a

{"instruction":"How to have a romantic relationship with an egotistic person?","response":"An egotistic person can be someone who is prone to talking about themselves frequently, or someone who appears vain or boastful. It can also be used to indicate someone who is opinionated, self-centered, or selfish, as well. As you can imagine, being in a relationship with an egotistic person can have its challenges. If you feel you are dating an egotistic individual, work towards dealing with the egotism in the relationship. It is also important to communicate your needs to your partner, and make sure you are taking care of yourself\n\n## Deal with the egotism in the relationship\n\n1. Have a direct conversation about it. This is important and has a direct effect on your happiness, their happiness, and the success of the relationship. Don't waste time and energy trying indirect ways to \u201cmake her change.\u201d It will just come across as manipulative and potentially cause resentment from your partner. Instead have a real, honest, and direct conversation about it. Start by letting her know you need to talk. \u201dAlice, I think we really need to talk. There's been something that has really be bothering me.\u201d\n\t* Explain what the issue is for you; specific to your relationship. For example, if your partner is selfish or egotistical in conversations and making it about her, you could say, \u201cI feel like when we talk, it isn't really equal. I love hearing about your day, but I'd really like for you to hear about my day too. When we talk, it feels really unevenly focused.\u201d\n\t* Ask for her input: \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n2. Urge the person to grow and mature. One of the great things you get to do in a relationship is to build each other up and watch each other grow. Help your partner grow by growing with him. Instead of focusing just on the person, try shift the focus to the relationship or the both of you working on the same thing. You can try tasks like taking a relationship selfishness checklist test to increase your partner and your awareness of any selfishness in your relationship. Humans are social creatures and tend to unconsciously adopt the goals of those close to us. Just like couples who learn a sport, how to cook, or a new language together, you can learn how to be less selfish and opinionated together. Make sure to celebrate and praise each other for positive changes you are making. The better you both feel about it, the more likely you are to continue to work towards the goal.\n3. Be patient. This may be the most difficult part. If you are with an egotistic person, you may realize that changing these parts of yourself can take time. Much like breaking a bad habit, you may have to be patient with your partner as she works on changing. Additionally, expect some backsliding into previous bad behaviors during this transition time and try not to be too hard on her. One way you can address this is to have a funny thing you do or say if you notice your partner slipping back into her selfish habits. Agree to an action or a phrase during your conversation. If you make it something you both find funny, it can take the pressure off of pointing it out. The \"Cut it out\" hand motion Uncle Joey used in Full House. Playing a funny song such as Toby Keith's \"I wanna talk about me.\" Saying, \"Hold on, I haven't had enough coffee for this conversation yet.\" Pick something that is funny to you and your partner, like an inside joke that only you share.\n4. Boost the person's self-esteem. This may seem like a strange suggestion for an egotist, but often inflated egos and selfishness are rooted in low self-esteem or shame. Think of it as overcompensation. Your partner may have low self esteem causing him to exaggerate and inflate his outward display of what he thinks about himself. It turns out that he may be trying to convince himself of his greatness along with everyone else. Help him boost his self-esteem. Avoid complaining about him or harshly criticizing him as it will only make him feel more threatened. When you are talking to him focus on his strengths and try to draw on the potential of those strengths. Compliment him not just for his looks, but for how he acts and what he does.\n5. Accept that the person may never change. The most difficult part about any interpersonal relationship is when you realize that you have almost zero power to change someone else. People can change, but that change has to come mainly from them. They have to want it. So if you are intent on a relationship with an egotistic person, your first step is to be real with yourself about the likelihood of the other person changing and begin to accept the selfish parts of her personality that you may not agree with. While you cannot change other people, you can help them to change. You can also control how you react to their egotism and the effect you let it have on your life.\n\n\n## Communicate your need\n\n1. Make time to talk about you. Your egotist may tend to talk about themselves frequently and at great lengths. If you feel like your partner does not give you enough space to talk about you, address it. You deserve to have this relationship and this partner be as much of a sounding board as he expects you to be for him. Try addressing it directly, or making it more of a new pattern in your conversations. \"John, I really need to talk to you about something that is bothering me. I know you have things you want to say as well, but I really need someone to listen. Would you be willing to focus on just this problem and help me?\u201d\n\t* Bring up topics more regularly that you are interested it. You may have gotten into the habit of just listening to your partner and letting him control the conversations. Start a new pattern of conversation by interjecting with topics you are interested in or thoughts you are having.\n2. Share your feelings. There is a solid chance that your egotistic partner is going to do or say something that makes you angry or sad at some point, because what you are doing is difficult and can be frustrating. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when you are working through some things. If you are really bothered by a particular action of your partner or by something she said, tell her. Try to add a compliment or a praise in and then tell her what upsets you, carefully and tactfully. \"Jane, I love it when you teach me how to cook. You are really good at it, and I want to learn. It just really hurts me when you tell it to me like I'm a nine year old kid.\" \u201dI understand you have a very strong opinion about this. Maybe you know more about it than I do, too. I would just really like for you to respect my opinion even if it is different than yours and not laugh at me for sharing it with you.\u201d\n\n\n## Care for yourself\n\n1. Be true to yourself. Be careful not to change who you are in your relationship with an egotist. A selfish person will bring out the giver or the care-taker in you; which could be potentially harmful. Don't feel like you have to change yourself to accommodate him. Resist the urge to stifle who you are or even what you are good at out of fear of how your partner will react. Just as you may have to accept that your partner is selfish, he have to accept that you are going to be just who you are as well. That should just be one more thing he loves about you.\n2. Enjoy other interests. If you find you are the giver in the relationship and you feel that your partner is always taking, then invest some of your energy into other interests to protect yourself from the relationship imbalance. Make sure you are giving yourself and your interests the attention and care you deserve. Take classes or carve out time in your schedule to do things that you enjoy, focusing on self-care and your own needs. You can always put your giving energy into volunteering as well. Try organizations such as Volunteer Match.\n3. Acknowledge your feelings. Even if your partner is trying to change, there are potential pitfalls that come from being in a relationship with an egotist. You may be helping her change, being patient while she works through some things, and trying to boost her self-esteem. Make sure, during this time, you are staying aware of how you feel. There may be some ups and down, and it is important you remain aware of how it is affecting you. Keep track of how happy you are in the relationship and how your day-to-day life is being affected. Notice how drained or exhausted you are feeling and make sure to give yourself the time and attention needed to recover. Try not to let this relationship become all-consuming for your life. Spend time with friends, or work on a hobby or interest that is important to you. Set firm boundaries if she tries to push your buttons or engage you in a fight. You can say something like, \"I'm not going to respond when you're yelling at me like this. I'm going to go in the other room and we can talk again in an hour when we've calmed down.\"\n4. Find a support system. While you are navigating this change together, it is important that you both have support systems you can use as a resource. Use your existing support system or create one for yourself. Focus on people that help you and make you feel good about yourself. They should be people that you trust and feel comfortable with. They may include:\n\t* Friends\n\t* Family\n\t* Religious Community\n\t* Counselors or therapists\n5. Consider leaving the relationship if it is not making you happy. It is not always a healthy idea to stay with an egotist. He may not be able or willing to change in the way you need him to. If he is not willing to work on the relationship then this may continue to make you feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. It may be better for you to leave the relationship and move onto something that's healthier for you.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to make surf wax?","response":"## Make warm water wax\n\n1. Heat water in a double broiler. Pour in about 1 \u00bd cups (354.8 ml) of water in the bottom of a double broiler. Heat on medium heat until the water is hot and steaming. You do not need to boil the water, you just need it to be hot enough to melt the beeswax through steaming. If you don't have a double broiler, you can also simply heat water in a pot on the stove, then put an equal sized pot on top of it to create the effect of a double broiler.\n2. Place the beeswax and coconut oil in the top of the double broiler. Once the water has heated and is steaming, place 1 cup (240 ml) of beeswax and \u00bc cup (60 ml) of coconut oil in the top pan of the double broiler. Place the top of the double broiler on top of the bottom pan.\n3. Melt the ingredients, stirring constantly. Once you place the beeswax and coconut oil over the bottom of the broiler, they should begin to melt. As they melt, stir the ingredients constantly so that they don't get stuck to the sides of the pan.\n4. Add in essential oils. If you want your wax to be fragrant, add a few of drops of essential oils when the wax and coconut oil have melted and mixed together. Popular oils to use are lavender, peppermint, lemon or rosemary. If you prefer the subtle scent of the coconut oil, don't add any essential oil.\n\n\n## Make cold water wax\n\n1. Find a healthy conifer. Cold-water wax differs from warm-water wax because it requires the addition of tree resin. To extract tree resin, first find a conifer tree that generally looks healthy, with relatively smooth, tight bark and without many dead branches or limbs. Conifer trees are trees that grow conifers, the cone-like growths that grow on tree branches. Examples of conifers are pine, spruce, maple and cedar trees. If you don't want to extract tree resin yourself, you can find it on Ebay or other online sites.\n2. Create a flat, cleared area on the face of the tree. Once you have found a suitable tree, use a machete or a hatchet to cut downward on the bark about 3 feet from the ground. Make a rectangle that is about 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. Try to cut cleanly so that you cut out a flat area about 1 inch deep into the tree.\n3. Place a bucket under the tree. Place a bucket against the tree directly underneath where you made the rectangular indent. Use a flat piece of metal or another smooth material to make a ramp that leads from the cleared rectangle into the bucket. The ramp will catch the resin as it comes out of the tree and lead it into the bucket. Therefore, it's important that the ramp is flush against the tree and leads directly into the bucket.\n4. Cut V-shaped notches into the cleared rectangle. After you set up the bucket, use the hatchet or machete to hack into the cleared rectangle you made, forming V-shaped notches that are about half an inch from each other. It may be easier to do one side of the \u201cV\u201d at a time, hacking downward slashes on the left half of the rectangle and then hacking upward slashes on the other side of the rectangle.\n5. Check the bucket every day. Collecting tree resin isn't instantaneous. You may have to wait several days for enough resin to collect. Keep the bucket under the tree and check on it daily. When it looks like you have about \u00bc cup of resin, remove the bucket from the tree and transfer the resin to a small bowl. It should take two to three days to collect \u00bc cup (60 ml) of resin.\n6. Use a double broiler to melt ingredients and form the wax. Use the same steps used to make cold-water wax, adding in the additional ingredient of \u00bc cup (60 ml) of tree resin along with the beeswax and coconut oil in the top of the double broiler. The resulting wax will have a slightly stickier consistency than warm-water wax.\n\n\n## Put the wax in containers\n\n1. Pour the wax into a tin or container. Once the ingredients of the warm or cold water wax have fully mixed together, pour the wax into a container or tin large enough to fit it. Scrape the sides of the pan to be sure to get out all the wax. Use a tin or container that has a top so that the wax won't dry out.\n2. Let the surf wax harden. Before you close the container of surf wax, leave the wax out to harden for three to four hours or overnight. Leaving the container open lets the heat escape so that the wax can harden faster, and so its consistency stays the same.\n3. Use the wax or close and store the container. After the wax has hardened, it is ready for use. When you are done using the wax, place the lid on the container and store it in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to apply for a marriage license in kentucky?","response":"Getting a marriage license if Kentucky is a relatively simple process. The couple needs to visit a county clerk\u2019s office, complete an application, and pay an application fee. There are some additional requirements if either party is under 18 years old.\n\n## Get a marriage license in kentucky if both party be over 18\n\n1. Visit the county clerk\u2019s office to apply for a marriage license. You can apply to any county clerk\u2019s office, unless the bride-to-be is under 18 years old. In that case, you must apply at the clerk\u2019s office in the county where she resides. Both parties must be present to obtain a license. Some counties have more than one office. For example, Jefferson County has seven different branch locations you could use. Check your county\u2019s website for specific locations.\n2. Present your identification. You will need to present a Social Security card or some other government-issued form of identification in order to complete the application for a marriage license. Until July 15, 2016, the county clerk is required to report the Social Security numbers of all marriage license applicants to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to verify that there are no outstanding child support issues. After July 15, 2016, the Social Security number will be requested as a form of identification, but the number will not be recorded or shared with any other agency. At least one county clerk\u2019s website says that a Social Security card is not required, but some other identification is acceptable (driver\u2019s license, passport). You may wish to check with the specific clerk you intend to use.\n3. Complete the marriage license application. The application will ask you to provide certain information, along with signing a statement that all the information is true, to the best of your knowledge. The information that you must provide, for each person, is:\n\t* name\n\t* date of birth\n\t* place of birth\n\t* race\n\t* gender\n\t* current marital \u201csituation\u201d (single, divorced, widowed)\n\t* number of previous marriages\n\t* occupation\n\t* current residence (you must provide your residence, but you are not required to be a Kentucky resident)\n\t* relationship to each other (in Kentucky, nobody who is related any closer than second cousin may get married)\n\t* full names of parents\n\t* date of marriage\n4. Pay the fee for the marriage license. In any county in Kentucky, the fee for obtaining a marriage license is $35. The clerk\u2019s office is able to accept cash, certified checks, cashier's checks or money orders. In some cases, credit cards are acceptable as well. You should check the county\u2019s website or call the clerk\u2019s office to verify.\n5. Complete the marriage ceremony within 30 days of receiving your license. If the 30-day time frame lapses, both applicants must repeat the whole process, which includes re-paying the $35 fee.\n\n\n## Get a marriage license in kentucky if either party be under 18\n\n1. Apply in the county where the bride lives. This is a requirement if the bride-to-be is under 18 years old. Otherwise, you can apply in any county in Kentucky, if the bride-to-be is 18 years old or older. There is no similar requirement based on the age of the male.\n2. Get your parents\u2019 consent. If either of the people getting married is under 18, but over 16, then that person's parent must consent to the marriage, in writing. If both the bride and groom are under 18, then the parents of each must consent. Your parents will need to complete a Consent to Marriage Form, which is available from the clerk\u2019s office. This applies to people who are under 18, but over 16, years old. This includes people who have had their 16th or 17th birthday. If your parents are divorced or separated and there has been an order issuing them joint custody, then they both must sign the application. If your parents are divorced or separated but there has not been an order of joint custody, then the parent who has legal custody must be the one to give consent. If a court has ordered a legal guardian for the person under 18, then that guardian must give consent.\n3. Get an order from a judge under special circumstances. If the female getting married is pregnant, and is under 16 years of age, then you must apply for an order from a District Judge to get a marriage license. This is the only circumstance that allows someone under 16 years old to get married. There is an additional $5 fee for a District Judge consent order.\n4. Be prepared for the consequences if you don\u2019t have consent. If someone under 18 gets married in Kentucky without the proper consent, the court will issue a \u201creceiver.\u201d This is someone, appointed by the court, who will take legal possession and control of your property until you turn 18. During that time, the receiver will pay your bills and expenses, and is entitled to take a fee for his services out of your property as well.\n5. Complete the marriage license application. After you have the appropriate consent, you will both need to visit the county clerk and complete the marriage license application. You will need proper identification, in the form of a social security card, passport or driver's license, and a $35 fee. To complete the application, you will need to provide:\n\t* name\n\t* date of birth\n\t* place of birth\n\t* race\n\t* gender\n\t* current marital \u201csituation\u201d (single, divorced, widowed)\n\t* number of previous marriages\n\t* occupation\n\t* current residence (you must provide your residence, but you are not required to be a Kentucky resident)\n\t* relationship to each other (in Kentucky, nobody who is related any closer than second cousin may get married)\n\t* full names of parents\n\t* date of marriage\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to draw homer simpson?","response":"Homer Simpson is a widely recognizable cartoon character, in part because of the popularity of The Simpsons cartoon series, and also because of his comical representation of American working class stereotypes. The following answer will show you how to draw him, step-by-step.\n\n## Homer's head\n\n1. Draw one circle. This will be the eye.\n2. Draw a small circle, about half the size of the other one.\n3. Draw a horizontally straight line from the end of the nose to the eye.\n4. Draw another circle, the same size as the eye. It must be exactly in line with it, horizontally. It must 'wrap' around the nose.\n5. Erase the parts that overlap the nose and the first eye, as the first eye should be more in the foreground.\n6. Draw a curved line that stretches from the bottom point of the nose, to about in line with the far side of the first eye.\n7. Draw another curved line from the same point as the previous one, but pointing down, in a south-east direction. Its length must be about the height of one of the eyes.\n8. Draw another curved line from the finishing point of the last one, pointing slightly down. Its length will be the same as the vertical height of the nose.\n9. Draw a small curved line, slightly smaller than the last one, that goes from the finishing point of the last one, pointing south-west.\n10. From the ending point of the line in Step 9, draw yet another curved line that points south-east, that is slightly longer than the vertical height of one of the eyes.\n11. Draw a curved line from the point of the last one, to the point of the one in Step 12.\n12. Add any expression of your choice to the mouth.\n13. Draw a circle that is about the size of the curved part of Homer's skull (see picture above). Chop off half to make it a semi-circle, but at an angle.\n14. Move the semicircle to a suitable point.\n15. Make a small lump above the second eye (see picture).\n16. Draw a straight line from the top of the lump, to the bottom of the semicircle.\n17. Draw a curved line from the other point of the skull semicircle that stretches all the way down past the mouth.\n18. Create a circle about half the size of the eye, and cut a small part off. This will be the ear.\n19. Draw the line that appears on homers ear(see picture).\n20. Add the two curved hairs at the top, and the other ones just above the ear.\n21. Add pupils to the eyes at any desired point.\n22. Fill the face and Homer's beard with appropriate colours.\n\n\n## Homer's face and body\n\n1. Draw 2 circles as eyes. Place two dots for the pupils in both circles.\n2. Draw the nose shaped as a sausage under the eyes.\n3. Draw a bow that is pointing to the left for the first part for the mouth.\n4. Draw another bow that is pointed to the right and is connected to the other bow.\n5. Draw Homer's head above his eyes.\n6. Draw his hair making 4 half circles.\n7. Draw Homer's neck and ear, for the ear you can simply draw a half of a small circle.\n8. Draw the collar right under his neck.\n9. Draw under the collar Homer's tummy.\n10. Draw the 2 sleeves from his shirt.\n11. Draw under his sleeve his arm with the hand.\n12. Draw the start of his pants and legs.\n13. Draw his leg and shoe under his visible arm.\n14. Draw his other leg and shoe next to the other one.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Homer Simpson is a cartoon character.","max_prob":13.9122533798,"ccp":-0.0004313497},{"claim":"Homer Simpson is widely recognizable.","max_prob":22.4445476532,"ccp":-0.0004313497},{"claim":"The Simpsons is a cartoon series.","max_prob":5.0379290581,"ccp":-0.9974269132},{"claim":"The Simpsons cartoon series is popular.","max_prob":8.1738824844,"ccp":-0.6831613114},{"claim":"Homer Simpson comically represents American working class stereotypes.","max_prob":37.9526176453,"ccp":-0.000042046},{"claim":"A circle is drawn.","max_prob":4.6089935303,"ccp":-0.165550292},{"claim":"The circle is the same size as the eye.","max_prob":7.4866919518,"ccp":-0.1108675253},{"claim":"There is a point from which a previous curved line was drawn.","max_prob":11.8016548157,"ccp":-0.1611577406},{"claim":"A new curved line is to be drawn from the same point as the previous one.","max_prob":12.3613128662,"ccp":-0.3818823105},{"claim":"The new curved line should point down.","max_prob":7.6201915741,"ccp":-0.2145896723},{"claim":"The new curved line should be in a south-east direction.","max_prob":19.4075660706,"ccp":-0.1494845575},{"claim":"Draw a small curved line.","max_prob":5.4513840675,"ccp":-0.2292678309},{"claim":"The small curved line is slightly smaller than the last one.","max_prob":14.52384758,"ccp":-0.2894919239},{"claim":"The small curved line goes from the finishing point of the last one.","max_prob":10.8759870529,"ccp":-0.1780738139},{"claim":"The small curved line points south-west.","max_prob":10.6615209579,"ccp":-0.0830328425},{"claim":"There is an ending point of a line in Step 9.","max_prob":14.2389183044,"ccp":-0.5595655592},{"claim":"A curved line is to be drawn from the ending point of the line in Step 9.","max_prob":19.8950824738,"ccp":-0.0038091586},{"claim":"The curved line points south-east.","max_prob":13.7086639404,"ccp":-0.3151794121},{"claim":"The curved line is slightly longer than the vertical height of one of the eyes.","max_prob":10.6617870331,"ccp":-0.3108759151},{"claim":"A bow is drawn.","max_prob":2.796849966,"ccp":-0.3048978425},{"claim":"The bow is pointed to the right.","max_prob":6.3815732002,"ccp":-0.7015259284},{"claim":"The bow is connected to another bow.","max_prob":9.3329801559,"ccp":-0.159390595},{"claim":"Draw Homer's neck.","max_prob":4.5715408325,"ccp":-0.1590325608},{"claim":"Draw Homer's ear.","max_prob":8.1028928757,"ccp":-0.0010303858},{"claim":"For the ear, you can simply draw half of a small circle.","max_prob":24.6969852448,"ccp":-0.0001126028}]}
{"instruction":"How to cope with being unloved by your parents?","response":"Parents are supposed to love, guide and protect their children. They are supposed to help them grow and develop as independent people. Unfortunately, some parents mistreat, abuse, neglect, or abandon their children instead. Feeling like your parents don't love you hurts emotionally and sometimes physically.  The best way to get past it is to accept that you cannot change other people and focus on yourself.\n\n## Develop cop mechanisms\n\n1. Talk to a trustworthy friend or family member. Sometimes just talking to someone about what you are dealing with can make you feel better. Try talking to a trustworthy friend or family member about what has been happening in your home life. For example, you could try talking with a close friend about the way that your parents make you feel. Choose someone you feel comfortable talking to and who you know will not turn around and repeat what you said to your parents. Try to avoid becoming too dependent on this person for your emotional needs. Just talk when you need someone to listen to you. If you find yourself calling several times a day for reassurance, then you may be developing a codependent relationship with this person. Talk to your school counselor or therapist if you find yourself depending more and more on other people for validation.\n2. Find a mentor. Mentors can guide you through important life decisions and teach you things that your parents are not willing or able to teach you. You can find a mentor to help you learn new skills for navigating difficult situations, succeeding in school, or advancing your professional career. Try asking a trustworthy, responsible adult in your life to mentor you, such as a coach, a teacher, or a boss. If your coach or boss offers to mentor you, make sure that you take him or her up on that offer; however, you can also try asking someone to mentor you, such as by saying, \u201cI admire your success in life and I hope to achieve many of the same things you have someday. I am not sure how to get there. Would you be willing to mentor me?\u201d\n\t* Try to avoid becoming too dependent on your mentor. Keep in mind that a mentor cannot replace your parents you should not look to this person for parental guidance. A mentor is just someone who can help you reach your goals in school, work, or in another specific area of your life.\n3. Seek help from a therapist or school counselor. Learning to cope with your parents\u2019 behavior can be difficult, so you may need to seek help from a therapist or school counselor. A therapist or your school counselor can help you to develop coping mechanisms and begin to feel better about yourself. If your school has a counselor, stop by and see if you can make an appointment to talk. If you feel uncomfortable doing this or you're not sure how to go about it, talk to a teacher you trust. You may also try asking your counselor if you can see a therapist by saying something like, \u201cI have been struggling with some things lately, and I would like to see a therapist to talk about them. Can you help me find one?\u201d\n\t* Keep in mind that if your parents are abusing you, then your therapist or school counselor will be required to report it.\n4. Resist comparing how they treat you and your siblings. If your parents seem to favor a sibling over you, it doesn\u2019t mean they love one of you any more or less. There could be a situational reason why they treat your sibling with more thoughtfulness or effort. Most of the time it is also unintentional, and your parents may not even realize they are treating you differently. Most aren\u2019t trying to make you feel unloved but aren\u2019t aware of how their actions affect kids mentally and emotionally. Try not to focus on how your parents treat your siblings. Instead, just focus on your relationship with them\n5. Try not to take it personally. It can be hard to dismiss criticism and hurtful language from people who are supposed to love you, even if you know that what they are saying isn\u2019t true. Remember that your parents\u2019 behavior and words is about them and not about you. The next time one of your parents says something mean or does something to hurt you, try telling yourself, \u201cI am a good person who is lovable, beautiful and worthy. My parents are just struggling with personal issues and that is why they said\/did that.\u201d\n6. Be kind to yourself. Some children who are mistreated by their parents treat themselves badly as well, such as by cutting, using alcohol or drugs, or intentionally failing at school. Performing these unhealthy, harmful activities will not make you feel better in the long run. Instead of doing these things, make sure that you nurture yourself, such as by:\n\t* \n\t* Maintaining a healthy diet. Exercising moderately most days of the week. Starting a daily meditation practice. Not smoking and not using drugs or alcohol.\n7. Replace negative self-talk with self-love. People who grow up in unloving households may be more prone to negative self-talk and have low self-esteem. To train your mind to think positive things about yourself, replace the negative thoughts with positive ones. For example, if you hear yourself repeating something your parents said like \u201cYou\u2019re stupid if you can\u2019t figure out division problems,\u201d you might replace it with: \u201cLearning long division is challenging, but I can succeed by working hard at it. I can also ask my math teacher for help.\"\n8. Write yourself a positivity cheat sheet. It may help you to examine any negative thoughts that are interfering with your ability to love yourself and write some positive thoughts to replace them. To get started, make a chart with four columns. In the first column, make a list of your negative beliefs. These might include things like, \u201cI am not good at making decisions,\u201d or, \u201cI am not very smart.\u201d\n\t* In the second, explain why you believe these things. Did your parents tell you these things or do things to cause you to feel this way? In the third column, think about what believing this is costing you emotionally and in your personal life: are you depressed, withdrawn, afraid to try new things and fail, afraid to trust others or let people in, etc.? List briefly but specifically what you are missing out on by letting yourself continue believing this negative self-image. Then for the final column, rewrite the thought to make it positive. For example, you might change a thought about your intelligence to something like, \u201cI am an intelligent, capable person and I have accomplished many things using my brain.\u201d\n9. Get out of the house more. Developing a happy, full life outside of your home will help you to feel happier even if your home life is not happy. Finding valuable ways that you can contribute to the world while being an active part of your community can help you rebuild your self-worth and confidence by focusing your attention on your well-being and happiness. Try volunteering for a local non-profit organization, getting a job that you will enjoy, or joining a youth organization or sports team.\n\n\n## Stay healthy and safe\n\n1. Report any physical or sexual abuse. If you are being abused, then seek help right away. Talk to a teacher, your doctor, a counselor, or call the police or children\u2019s services and ask for help. Chronic abuse gets harder to recover from the longer it goes on. Don\u2019t allow abusive people, even family, to cause you permanent physical or emotional damage. Get away from them as soon as possible. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at (800) 799-SAFE to talk about your situation and options. Don't hesitate to dial 911 if you think you or another family member is in immediate danger. You aren\u2019t going to get in trouble for reporting that someone else is breaking the law!\n2. Sever your relationship, if possible. If you are able to break ties with your abusive parent, do so. It is hard to give up on anyone you care about, especially family, but your primary responsibility is to take care of yourself. Don\u2019t feel guilty for severing contact with your parent(s) if you feel it\u2019s the best thing for you. If you are not sure cutting off all contact is necessary, consider the amount of pain they cause you vs. the amount of happiness. Dysfunctional parents may show love sometimes, typically when it serves their own interests, but a little love now and then isn\u2019t enough to justify staying in a bad relationship with anyone.\n3. Resist the urge to isolate yourself from peers and other adults. You might think avoiding relationships altogether will prevent you from getting hurt any more or by anyone else, but human beings need social relationships to thrive. Children who grow up without a loving parent or an alternative parental figure are less successful, less happy, and physically sicker as adults. Keep talking to your friends and other family members regularly, go spend time with them whenever possible, and be open to meeting new friends and trustworthy adults. Not every adult or loved one will end up treating you like your parent does. Don\u2019t be afraid to give others a chance to love you. Long-term loneliness can have serious health effects, worsening or even maybe causing diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and neurological disorders. It may even cause cancer to spread faster.\n4. Learn how to be independent. If your dysfunctional parents aren\u2019t teaching you how to make it on your own after high school, ask another adult you trust how to prepare for the \"real world.\" Learn this like how to create a budget, how to do laundry, how to turn on the water heater in your first apartment. Estimate the costs of independent living and what you will need to get started. Get a job and save up money for a security deposit on your first apartment and some furniture. Maintain good grades despite trouble at home so you have the option of going to college. Ask your school counselor to help you find scholarships to pay for it.\n\n\n## Recognize toxic parent\n\n1. Consider how your parents respond to your accomplishments. One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, \u201cSo what? It\u2019s just a test.\u201d\n2. Think about any controlling behaviors that your parents use. It is normal for parents to want to guide you, but parents who try to control your behavior may be toxic. This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college.\n3. Note a lack of emotional connection. Parents who have healthy relationships with their children show their emotional bond by making eye contact with their children, smiling at them, and offering affection in the form of hugs. If your parents have toxic behaviors, then they might not do any of these things. For example, a parent who shows appropriate emotional connection with his child might comfort her if she is crying; however, a parent who lacks an emotional connection with his child might ignore the child or yell at her to stop crying.\n4. Consider the boundaries between you and your parents. Healthy boundaries are important in parent-child relationships. If you have good boundaries with your parent, then you should not feel like your lives are one and the same. For example, a parent who has healthy boundaries with her child might ask how her child's friends are doing, but would not insist on hanging out with her child and his friends.\n5. Reflect on any verbal abuse you have suffered. Verbal abuse is another form of toxic parenting. If your mother or father call you names, put you down, or just say things to hurt your feelings, then these are all forms of verbal abuse. For example, your parents should say things to build you up and make you feel good about yourself; however, you would feel bad if your parent said something like, \u201cYou\u2019re worthless!\u201d or, \u201cI can\u2019t stand to be in the same room with you!\u201d\n\t* Some parents will be kind and reassuring one day and then mean and critical the next day. But keep in mind that this is still verbal abuse, even if your parents are not always cruel to you.\n6. Identify narcissistic behaviors. Parents who are too focused on themselves to notice their children or to treat them properly can also be toxic. If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic. For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child\u2019s welfare.\n7. Think about any parenting roles you played. Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and\/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead.\n8. Judge their behavior over what they say. Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don\u2019t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren\u2019t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says \u201cI love you,\u201d but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to help make cellulite less visible?","response":"Have cellulite? Don't worry: Almost all women have it. However, few if any women want it. There are ways you can reduce the orange peel-like dimpling that occurs on the skin, usually on the legs, thighs and butt. It\u2019s a myth that cellulite is always tied to obesity. Some thin people still have cellulite. However, your chances of cellulite grow with obesity, so exercise and choosing a healthier diet matters.\n\n## Make cellulite less obvious\n\n1. Get a tan. Whether it\u2019s a spray tan or a natural one, tanned butts and legs don\u2019t show cellulite as much. If you already have a dark complexion, you\u2019re lucky because darker skin doesn\u2019t show cellulite as much as pale skin does. Always take caution when tanning, though. The sun\u2019s rays can lead to skin cancer, so it's usually a better choice to get an authentic looking fake tan. There are many ways to do this: airbrush or booth spray tanning at a salon and home products such as foam, lotion, or spray. When applying tanning lotion, start by exfoliating the skin with a body scrub, as well as shaving any areas where you don't want hair. Then, using gloves, apply the lotion all over your body, starting with the head area, and taking care not to get it into your eyes. Apply petroleum jelly to your eyebrows to prevent them from becoming discolored. When spray tanning, it\u2019s very important that you wear recommended protective gear (over eyes, nose, and other body openings) so you don\u2019t ingest the tanning particles during the process. If using a booth, you will be instructed to turn inside the booth as a nozzle sprays you with the solution.\n2. Start toning your legs. While genetics might make you more susceptible to cellulite, toned legs with strong muscle definition tend to show cellulite less. Run up a staircase, go for a long walk or jog, and use a stair master or elliptical trainer. All of these exercises and equipment target the leg and butt areas where cellulite resides. Contrary to popular myth, cellulite is not caused by toxins in the body. It\u2019s caused by a lack of exercise and muscle tone, excess fat, poor circulation, genetics and hormones. Leg lifts and squats are among the exercises that can help you tone your legs.\n3. Strength train. Although running and other cardio can reduce your weight, which can make cellulite less obvious, strength training will be best at getting rid of the dimpled look. Yoga routines help tone the body and reduce the appearance of cellulite, as do strength-training routines that build muscle. Studies have shown that people who combine cardio with strength training (weight lifting, some circuit training routines) added muscle in addition to losing fat, and improved the overall look of their bodies. As little as 15 minutes of cardio (such as running) and 15 minutes of strength training (such as weight lifting) three times a week can make a difference over time (at least eight weeks).\n4. Try anti-cellulite clothing. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but some clothing manufacturers make clothing marketed to reduce the look of cellulite. These pieces of clothing, such as capri leggings, are designed to generate heat that in turn helps break down cellulite cells. Elastic underwear has the opposite effect; it can make cellulite look worse. Wear non-elastic undergarments made of smooth fabric. Loose fitting clothing helps reduce cellulite because tighter clothing impairs blood flow throughout the day.\n\n\n## Improve the diet to reduce cellulite\n\n1. Drink a lot of green tea. Green tea has many health benefits. Some people drink it as part of weight reduction efforts, but it can also reduce the sight of cellulite. Green tea is a good choice for people who find it boring to drink plain water all day long. You can drink it cold or hot. Green tea doesn\u2019t add many calories to your daily intake, but it\u2019s very rich in antioxidants. The tea will increase your metabolism. Cellulite can occur with age because it\u2019s associated with lower production of estrogen in the body. Drinking a lot of green tea can help reduce this effect. A faster metabolism means that your body should be able to expel toxins faster, which will reduce the look of cellulite.\n2. Drink a lot of water. There are many, many proven benefits to guzzling water. You should drink water all day long. Stay hydrated. Hydrated bodies won\u2019t have cellulite that looks so obvious. Other health benefits include shinier hair and younger looking skin. If you find drinking plain water too boring, add a lemon slice into it. It\u2019s a good idea to drink two liters of water every day and to drink water constantly throughout the day. Drinking a lot of water can also help with weight loss, which can further reduce cellulite. That\u2019s because when people feel hungry, sometimes it just means they are dehydrated.\n3. Avoid sugary beverages. Drinking beverages loaded with sugar will probably make cellulite worse (not to mention it can increase your weight). That means you should avoid carbonated sodas but also be aware of drinks that have hidden sugars, such as fruit juices. Study labels. Some beverage companies are experts at packaging and marketing and they might make you think that energy or fruit drink is healthy \u2013 until you read the label and see that it\u2019s loaded with sugar and carbs. It\u2019s always better to choose water than sugary beverages. Even diet sodas aren\u2019t great for the body because they have carbonation and chemicals.\n4. Try natural remedies. There are many natural remedies that some people swear help with cellulite. Give one of them a try and see if they work for you. Refrigerate the residue from your coffee grinds (black coffee). Mix them with olive oil to create a scrub that you apply to the cellulite-impacted area. Use circular motions to apply the rub for about 15 minutes. Then, leave the grinds on your body for about 15-20 minutes more before washing them away. Cover and warm the region with shrink wrap. Instead of coffee grounds, you could use salt and grapefruit juice to create a similar rub that some people say helps with cellulite.\n5. Eat healthier foods. Reducing the amount of toxins in your diet is good for many reasons. You will likely lose weight, be healthier, and your cellulite will reduce. Consume alkaline forming foods. Alkaline is found in fresh fruit and vegetables, which should make up the majority of your diet if you want to eat healthier. Sprinkle flaxseed on your breakfast to boost collagen growth. Sprinkle two tablespoons of it on oatmeal or yogurt. Fresh vegetable juicing is one way you can flood your body with healthy juice. Avoid eating processed foods as much as possible, especially foods that come in boxes and that are loaded with carbohydrates or sugar. Drink lemon juice and cayenne pepper three times a day.\n6. Eat kelp. Kelp can help you lose weight as well as improve the appearance of cellulite. It contains a chemical found in green plants that helps the body burn fat. Purchase dried kelp and add it to stir fries, soup or salad. You can also ingest kelp vitamins. Consider kelp \"sea vegetables.\" The kelp retains the minerals that are found in the ocean, making it very healthy for you. Kelp, sometimes called seaweed, also balances out the thyroid gland, improving your health. It's often found in Asian cooking.\n7. Stay away from too much salt or sugar. Salt and sugar can lead to serious health problems, as well as obesity, which makes cellulite more obvious. Avoid eating too much refined salt. Crystal and sea salt are healthier. Refined salt dehydrates the body and leaches minerals out of it. Sodium also causes the body to retain fluids, making cellulite look worse. Sodium can harm your health. Try to limit your sugar consumption to 6 teaspoons a day and your salt consumption to 200 mg of sodium.\n\n\n## Use chemical and other tool to reduce cellulite\n\n1. Try lasers. Some beauty salons and plastic surgeons offer treatments for cellulite that use lasers and other mechanical devices. There are downsides to these methods. They are often expensive, they need to be repeated regularly, they have to be done by a trained professional and can be painful. One example: Cellulaze is a procedure approved by the FDA for cellulite. A small laser is inserted under the skin to break down the cellulite\u2019s structure. Research carefully any such interventions and check into the licensing and ratings of the salon performing the functions, as well as the credentials and training of the person administering it. Laser toning and cold-laser massage are also techniques that are said to reduce the appearance of cellulite. The tri-active laser was approved by the FDA and claims to temporarily reduce cellulite\u2019s appearance. Fillers are sometimes used to treat cellulite dimples.\n2. Try a lotion. Many products advertise that they can help improve cellulite. Not all are that successful, but you could give them a try. You might find temporary help from ingredients that dilate blood and lymph vessels. Black pepper, green tea, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and ginkgo fall into this category, and some anti-cellulite creams contain them. Ointments containing forskolin (which comes from the herb coleus forskohlii) were found in one study to help women lose excess skin from their thighs. Skin firming cream can help build up collagen and diminish wrinkles. Some cellulite creams contain retinol, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C. Major brands like Lancome, L\u2019Oreal, and Nivea offer gels and lotions that are said to firm up the skin.\n3. Massage the affected area. Not only do massages feel great, but they are also known to reduce the look of unsightly cellulite dimples. Use a body brush with boar or just stiff bristles in a circular motion while you take a shower. Or use a hand-held massagers. Apply the massage head to the areas with cellulite. Add a skin firming serum, body lotion or anti-cellulite gel before you apply the massaging motions. Cellulite is caused by fat deposits that push through the skin\u2019s connective tissue, usually in the buttocks and thighs. Massaging the skin stimulates the lymphatic system that lies right underneath the skin\u2019s surface. This circulates toxins and causes the body to release them more quickly. Add a few drops of olive and juniper oil to the skin before massaging it.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to comfort a dying dog?","response":"Although it is a natural part of life, it is never easy saying goodbye to your beloved canine companion. During this stage of life, you will want to make your dog as comfortable as possible. The comfort you provide throughout this potentially frightening situation will make the transition easier for your dog and bring you peace of mind as well.\n\n## Comfort your dog at home\n\n1. Stay patient with your dog. Older dogs commonly begin experiencing joint and muscle problems, and they can become frustrated with their discomfort and impairments. If your dog is grumpy or irritable during the end stages of life, simply do your best to be patient and provide the other comforts you can at home.\n2. Provide a quiet environment. Chaos around the home will only stress both you and your dog as you're trying to spend the final hours of your dog's life together meaningfully and with compassion. Give your dog a quiet environment away from noisy children or other animals in the house. Soft, unobtrusive music can also be calming, or you may also use a nature soundtrack with birdsong and the sounds of running water.\n3. Speak in comforting tones. Reassure your dog that he's not alone and speak in soft comforting tones. Tell him \u201cgood boy\u201d and the other phrases you normally use for positive reinforcement to let him know it's okay. Give him plenty of light pets as well. If you want to make sure you're there for the final moments, then you may choose to sleep next to his bed in a sleeping bag for the final nights.\n4. Put down comfortable bedding. If your dog has a favorite dog bed, put it down for him. Otherwise you can put down some other blankets to help him lay down comfortably. Your dog may also have difficulty regulating his body temperature at the end, so keep some blankets handy to put over him in the event that he shows signs of being cold. Elderly dogs are also prone to pressure sores, so put down extra cushioning for an older dog. On a practical note, he may also have problems with incontinence at the end. Choose a spot you can easily clean and bedding you can wash later. If your dog does have any accidents, then clean them up patiently without scolding him. He can't help it. If your dog gets cold, you can also use a heater in the area to make him more comfortable.\n5. Keep fresh water available. Hydration is still important to keeping your dog comfortable even in the final hours. Provide a bowl of water next to the dog bed, so your dog doesn't have to get up to drink. If your is having trouble rising even to drink, then use a clean dropper to help provide water.\n6. Prepare some of his favorite meal. If your dog has always had a favorite thing to eat, then you should make some of it in case he's hungry. However, it is pretty common for dogs to lose their appetite in the end stages of life, so don't force him to eat if he's not hungry. Solid food may also upset your dog's stomach at the end as certain systems related to digestion begin shutting down. If your dog still shows a willingness to eat but regular food is upsetting his stomach, then try mixing some baby food with water, or you can also try the Hills A\/D diet, which is liquid.\n7. See your veterinarian about pain management. If your dog still has enough time and you're worried about pain in the final stages, then you can consult your vet for pain management options for the final days. Signs that your dog might be in pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath or reluctance to move.\n8. Hug your dog one final time. Once your dog passes, give him one final hug and say goodbye. It's a very painful moment, so remember that it's perfectly okay to cry, but also remember the good times you had with your pet and that he passed in a comfortable, loving environment with you doing everything you could. Be aware that some dogs seem to \"move\" or \"take a breath\" after passing away. As their nervous system shuts down, sometimes muscles in the body or lungs can spasm and look like a sign of life. It's also common for dogs to pass with their eyes open. You can close them if you want as you say your final goodbye, or you can pull one of the blankets over his head.\n9. Take care of yourself. Once your pet has passed, know that you did everything you could and worry about taking care of yourself. Seek comfort in other loved ones who understand the loss. You can also light candles or say a small prayer for your pet if it feels right and helps. The ASPCA also has a hotline you can call to talk to someone who understands the difficulty of losing a pet. You can reach this hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n10. Handle your pet's remains. Though it's unpleasant, you do have to do something with your pet's remains once he passes. Many people choose to cremate pets or bury them whether in a pet cemetery or closer to home. Many services are available to help you deal with the remains to make the process easier on you. Look online or ask your vet for services in your area that will help with the option of your choosing.\n\n\n## Comfort your dog at the vet\n\n1. Consult a professional about euthanasia. The ASPCA has a specific hotline for those dealing with the difficult decision of euthanizing a pet. The line gives you someone to talk to who will understand your grief throughout the process, as well as information about your dog's quality of life at this stage and whether or not euthanasia may be the most humane option. You can reach the ASPCA hotline at 1-877-GRIEF-10.\n2. Make the appointment. Though it hurts to do and it always feels too soon, you'll have to make an appointment for the vet to euthanize him when you know your dog is at the end of life. Your vet is likely to suggest this option if your dog's condition has significantly deteriorated and the vet believes the dog is in pain.\n3. Bring some of your dog's favorite items. You'll want to surround your dog with a few of his favorite things at the end. A favorite blanket and a soft toy are very common items that you may choose to bring with to help comfort him as he passes. Favorite blankets or a dog bed will also be much more comfortable for your dog than the exam table, especially if he's already in discomfort.\n4. Sign any forms at the vet. When you sign in for the appointment, you'll also have a few forms to fill out, including a consent form signaling that you know what is about to happen. While filling out forms is the last thing you want to focus on, it is a necessary part of the process.\n5. Ask about a sedative beforehand. If your dog is experiencing any pain or discomfort from a medical condition, ask the veterinarian about giving him a sedative. This will make your dog more comfortable, and it will give you the peace of mind later knowing that your dog passed without any pain.\n6. Pet your dog with gentle, loving strokes. Once you've been taken back to the private room and placed your dog down on his blankets with any other items, focus all your energy on spending quality final moments with him. The veterinarian will have to finish setting up the necessary items, so use this time to offer soft praise to your dog. Tell him you love him and pet him in his favorite spots.\n7. Hug your dog. Your vet will ensure you're ready and then begin injecting the solution to euthanize your dog. Many people choose to hug their dog during these moments because the process is fairly quick. Between six and twelve seconds after the solution is delivered, your dog will take a deep breath and then appear to fall into a deep sleep before taking a few more final breaths. Some pet owners also prefer not to be in the room for the actual injection and passing. The veterinarian's office is used to people who need to cope and grieve in their own ways. Ultimately decide what is right for you.\n8. Give yourself time. Do not be embarrassed to cry in front of the vet or other employees at the clinic. They all understand what you're going through. After your dog has passed away, your veterinarian will give you the option to spend some additional one-on-one time with your dog. Some owners take this opportunity to say a few last words to their dog while others choose to pass on this option.\n9. Discuss options for the remains. After giving you the time you need, your vet will discuss options concerning what to do with your dog's remains. This may include releasing them to you for burial or cremating them, which the vet can take care of. You can choose cremation either with the intent to take the cremains with you or not. In some places, it is against the law for the vet to return your pet's body to you for burial.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to treat a staph infection?","response":"Staphylococcus bacteria are commonly found on human skin and many surfaces. When the bacteria stays on your skin, it's generally fine; however, if the bacteria enters the skin through a cut, scrape, or bug bite, it can cause problems. It can create an infected wound, and if left untreated, can become life-threatening.[1]\nX\nTrustworthy Source\nMayo Clinic\nEducational website from one of the world's leading hospitals\nGo to source\n Seeing your doctor for treatment is a must if you think you have a staph infection.\n\n## Get treatment\n\n1. Look for signs of infection. A staph infection can show redness and swelling. It can also create pus. In fact, it can look much like a spider bite. The skin may also feel warm. These symptoms will generally be near where you have a cut or sore. There may also be pus or discharge draining from the wound.\n2. Seek professional medical attention as soon as possible. Staph infections can develop into a serious infection quickly. Therefore, if you think you have one, you should call your doctor. Your doctor will likely want you to come in as soon as possible, and she will give you instructions for the immediate future. If you have signs of infection as well as a fever, it is especially important you see your doctor. Your doctor may wish to see you immediately or send you to the emergency room for treatment.\n3. Clean the area with an antibiotic soap. In warm water, gently wash the area with soap. You can use a washcloth if you do so gently, but you shouldn't use that washcloth again before washing it. Don't try to pop the wound if it's a blister; that will only spread infection. If your wound needs to be drained, it should be done a by doctor. Make sure to wash your hands after cleaning the area. When you dry the wound, use a clean towel. Don't reuse it without washing it.\n4. Discuss whether your doctor will take a sample. Generally, your doctor will want to analyze a sample of tissue or a culture. The idea is he can check what strain of the infection you have; once identified, he will know which antibiotic that particular microbe is susceptible to.\n5. Expect your doctor to drain it. If you have a bad infection that creates an abscess or boil, your doctor will likely drain the pus from wound. You shouldn't feel much, as she will try to numb the area first. Draining a wound generally involves the doctor using a scalpel to make a small incision across it. After that, she'll let fluid drain out. If the wound is large, she may pack it with gauze that will need to be removed at a later time.\n6. Ask about antibiotics. Most of the time with staph infection, you will need to take a round of antibiotics. One reason staph is so dangerous is because some strains are becoming resistant to certain types of antibiotics. This includes Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which must be treated with IV antibiotics. Typically, you'd take cephalosporins, nafcillin, or sulfa drugs; however, you may need to take vancomycin instead, which is less resistant. The downside to this drug is your doctor must give it to you intravenously. A side effect of vancomycin may be the development of a severe, itch rash. It usually covers the neck, face, and upper torso. You cannot simply look at an infection and know that it is a staph or MRSA\n7. Understand when surgery is necessary. Sometimes, staph infections can develop around a medical device implanted in your body or a prosthetic. If that happens, you may need surgery to have the device removed.\n8. Watch for this complication with other injuries. Staph infections can be a problem in a number of situations, such as when you have surgery. You can also develop a serious condition called septic arthritis when staph bacteria enter a joint, which can happen sometimes when staph is in the bloodstream. If you have septic arthritis, you'll have trouble using that joint; you'll also likely notice quite a bit of pain, as well as some swelling and redness. You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\n\n\n## Prevent staph infections\n\n1. Wash your hands often. Staph gathers on the skin, including under your nails. By washing your hands, you are more likely to avoid introducing it to a scratch, scrape, or scab. When you wash your hands, you should scrub for 20 to 30 seconds with soap and warm water; using a throwaway towel afterwards is best. In addition, turn off the faucet with a towel so you don't touch the germy surface after washing your hands.\n2. Clean and cover cuts. When you get a cut or scrape, it's important to cover it with a bandage once you clean it up. Using an antibiotic ointment is also good practice. Doing so will help keep staph infection out of the wound.\n3. Wear gloves if you need to play doctor. If you're working on someone else's cut or wound, it's best to put on clean gloves if possible. If not, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards and try not to touch the wound itself with your bare hands. You can do things like put the antibiotic ointment on the bandage before placing it over the wound to keep from touching it.\n4. Shower after you exercise. You can pick up staph infection in the gym, hot tub, or steam room, so make sure to shower after you exercise to help wash it off. Always make sure the shower area is clean, and don't share shower supplies, such as razors, towels, and soap.\n5. Change tampons frequently. Toxic shock syndrome is a form of staph infection, and it is often caused by leaving a tampon in for longer than eight hours. Try to change your tampon every four to eight hours, and use the lightest tampon you can get away with. If you use a tampon that is too absorbent, it can increase your risk of a staph infection. If you're worried about toxic shock syndrome, try sticking to other methods to manage your period, such as pads.\n6. Increase the temperature. When doing your laundry, wash your linens, including your towels and sheets, in hot water. Hot water can help kill off the staph bacteria so it doesn't keep infecting you.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to start a food delivery business?","response":"Food-delivery businesses are a popular and fast-growing field. These businesses typically thrive in college towns, large cities, or other areas where large populations of adults are willing to pay to have food from restaurants delivered to them. The basic business model for this type of business is to approach local restaurants and ask to deliver their food, then charge a small commission for your company's profit. Build a small fleet of delivery drivers, and set up a website or app that your clients can use to order.\n\n## Strategizing and register your business\n\n1. Structure your business as an LLC to protect your finances. There are a variety of ways to structure a small business, but an LLC is one of the most common since it allows you to keep personal finances and business finances separate. To form your LLC, you'll need to file \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d with your state's secretary of state. Also, make sure that your company's name ends in \u201cLLC\u201d and open a bank account under the company's name. Most LLCs are \u201cmember-managed,\u201d meaning that all of the LLC's owners take an equal share in managing the company. If you were to not structure your business as an LLC, the bank (or other debtors) could come after your personal finances and savings if your business went bankrupt.\n2. Find a source to finance your business if necessary. When you're starting up your business, you may need financing in order to purchase delivery vehicles, rent office space, and pay for insurance and permits. If this is the case, finance your business by taking out a bank loan. Or, see if you can find prospective investors who may be interested in a chunk of your company's future stock. On the other hand, if you have several thousand dollars in savings and plan to start with just 2\u20133 drivers (with their own vehicles) and yourself, you probably don't need any financing.\n3. Select a catchy name that will stick in your customers' minds. You only get 1 chance to name your business, so make sure to select a name that describes your company. The name itself should also clue people in to some of your business's selling points. A clever name is also a great way to set yourself apart from some of your competitors. For instance, if you want to alert potential customers to your affordably-priced meals, use a word like \u201caffordable\u201d or \u201cbudget\u201d in your company name. Avoid bland or forgettable names like \u201cChicago Lunch Delivery.\u201d Instead, try something snappier, like, \u201cOn-Time People Food Delivery,\u201d \u201cSandwich in a Crunch Delivery,\u201d or \u201cFine Dining 2 You Food Delivery.\u201d\n4. Register your business with your state and local governments. Before you can begin conducting any business, you'll need to register your delivery company. Specifically, you need to register the business name with your local (and maybe state) government. If you live in the U.S., start the registration process by visiting the website for the secretary of state for the state you reside in. You'll also need to register to obtain a federal tax ID number. Registering your business name prevents others from using it. Registration also ensures that you'll receive legal and tax benefits as well as personal liability protection.\n5. Buy general liability insurance and any other kinds your state requires. Nearly all large insurance companies offer general liability business insurance. Speak to a representative from the company of your choice and ask them what level of insurance you're required to have in order to comply with state guidelines. Besides general liability, many states also require that you obtain workers' compensation insurance to protect the livelihoods of your employees.\n6. Obtain the required permits and licenses to operate in your state. If you live in the U.S., the licenses and permits you'll need in order to run a food-delivery business will vary from state to state. The state permits you need will also with your business's location and activities. Figure out which permits and licenses you'll need by checking out your state's secretary of state website. Your insurance company representative should also be able to advise you regarding the permits you'll need to file for. There may also be various fees associated with obtaining the permits and licenses. Unless you're planning to deliver alcoholic beverages, you shouldn't need to obtain any federal licenses.\n7. Calculate an operating budget for your delivery business. Add up all of your business's prospective expenditures, including renting office space (if applicable), driver salaries, insurance, and gas\/vehicle costs. Offset these by calculating your business's prospective income. Figure out how much money you can afford to spend on a monthly basis without going into the red. You can further break the budget up by separating necessary expenses (e.g., rent) from optional expenses (e.g., extra advertising) and finding ways to spend less on the optional expenses. As with any kind of business startup, you won't begin turning a profit right away. It may take a couple of years. Broadly speaking, startup costs for a food-delivery business average between $3,000-$25,000 USD. In most cases, this money will need to come out of your pocket. Also factor your employees' salaries into your budget. While you may start out paying delivery drivers minimum wage, advertising and graphic-design specialists will need salaries. Do some research online to calculate reasonable salary amounts that exceed the annual cost of living in your area.\n\n\n## Partner and arrange deliveries\n\n1. Cater to a specific market and demographic that you'd like to work with. Consider your potential client base. This will influence the type of restaurants that you approach about delivering their food. If you're undecided, drive around the area you live in and take note of the types of restaurants\u2014and restaurant clients\u2014that you see. Especially when you're first starting out, it makes sense to capitalize on the food markets that are already in place. This will also help you find a niche for your business, rather than attempting to serve too broad of a market. For example, ask yourself things like:\n\t* Do you want to sell cheap eats to hungry college kids? Or would you rather deliver gourmet meals to upscale town home residents? Alternately, would you prefer to deliver affordable lunches to businesspeople in an office-heavy district?\n2. Map out the delivery area that you'd like to serve. Whether you live in a large city or are delivering in a rural area, you'll need to decide on a reasonably-sized delivery area. Clients will expect your company to deliver their food promptly (within, say, 15\u201330 minutes), so you can start by setting a 15-minute radius around your delivery headquarters. Pick 2 or 3 neighborhoods and expand from there. Honing in on 1 or 2 specific parts of town is a great way to build a niche for your business. Even if people across town haven't heard of your company, people in the neighborhoods you cater to will be familiar with your delivery service! You can also decide on a delivery area based on the location of the people you hope to deliver to. For example, if you'll deliver fast lunches to busy businesspeople, look into focusing on densely-concentrated business centers or corporate campuses. Or, if you want to deliver late-night food to college kids, center your deliveries around student housing and affordable apartments in student-heavy areas of town.\n3. Meet with restaurant managers to discuss delivery partnerships. Start small by selecting 2 or 3 local restaurants that you think would appeal to your target audience. Ideally, the restaurants should be centrally located within your delivery area. Call and ask to meet with the manager. When you meet, explain that you're starting a food-delivery business to a lucrative audience and that you'd like to deliver their food. Explain to the managers that you won't be taking money from them; rather, you'll be establishing a partnership that should increase their profits. For example, if you're focusing on an upscale audience, start out by delivering food from a local 3- and 4-star restaurants. Avoid reaching out to chain restaurants, and instead focus on a diverse representation of your city's fine dining. Make it clear to the restaurants that your company holds many of the same values that their does. For example, explain that your company cares about healthy food access and food sustainability. Also ask each manager for a copy of the restaurant's menu to post on your website.\n4. Set a reasonable commission to receive on each order delivered. Food-delivery businesses make money by receiving a commission from the orders they deliver. But, the restaurants still need to make money off of the food they sell. When you sit down with each restaurant manager, hash out a commission amount that will let you keep your business afloat but not keep the restaurant from making profits. Try calculating various commission percentages based on the total amount of sales you hope to make in 1 month. The restaurant itself will pay the commission to your food-delivery business. For example, you may figure out that a 15% commission allows both you and the restaurant(s) to turn a profit. On the other hand, a 20% commission might cut too deeply into the restaurant's profits and a 10% commission might not allow your company to balance its budget.\n5. Choose a flat-rate delivery fee to charge customers on all orders. A flat-rate delivery fee, paid by your customers, will help your business turn a profit and can be used to pay your drivers. Select a low enough dollar amount that it won't deter customers from ordering food in the first place! Setting a delivery fee of $5\u20137 USD would be a good starting point. It would also be wise to set a minimum order amount. For example, you could require that customers pay at least $15 USD for their delivered meal.\n6. Designate a location to serve as the hub of your delivery business. Your business will need to have a headquarters, from which you can dispatch drivers and too which they'll return after each delivery. It's fine if this location is initially in your garage or out of the back of your apartment. However, as the company grows, be on the lookout for cheap office space or a cheap storefront to rent. This will allow you to expand and grow the business. Specify this primary location on your business cards and website so your customers know roughly where you're based. As your company grows, you can also set up offices for on-site personnel who aren't directly associated with food delivery (e.g., web specialists and advertisers).\n7. Hire delivery drivers who can start delivering food to clients. Delivery drivers will form the backbone of your delivery company, so you'll need to hire several before you can start delivering food. When you bring in the prospective drivers to interview them, make sure that each of the drivers has their own car and a legal driver's license. Ask the prospective hires about their availability, and make sure they understand that the majority of their working hours would fall on nights and weekends. It would also be wise to run a background check on each of the drivers to make sure they don't have a criminal history. If you're a student or live in a college town, try posting \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d ads in your student or local newspaper. If you'd like to hire more drivers\u2014say, 20\u201330 people\u2014post a job ad online in forums like Indeed and Monster to attract many applicants.\n8. Post job ads and hire people to fill other key company positions. Your food-delivery business will need an accountant to handle financial issues and a graphic-design specialist to come up with a company logo and design the website. As your driver base grows, you may need someone to oversee all of the drivers and manage their schedules, and someone to handle PR with the restaurants. Try posting job ads online through LinkedIn, Monster, and Indeed to find qualified individuals to hire. If you're starting the business out as a tiny, at-home operation, you may be able to fill all of these positions by yourself initially. However, the sooner you hire other employees, the faster your business will be able to grow and profit.\n\n\n## Deliver food and advertise your business\n\n1. Develop a website that lets users select a restaurant and purchase food. When your business is first starting out, the website can be straightforward. It should clearly present the different restaurant options whose food your business can deliver. After users select an option, the website can present the delivery options, each marked clearly with a price tag. Then, let users select their delivery address and entire their payment info to conclude each order. Design your website so that it's visually appealing and user friendly. If you don't know anything about coding, don't worry. There are plenty of website hosting pages that let you build websites for free. Check out options like Wix and WordPress.\n2. Create a companion app that functions similarly to the website. Many users\u2014especially younger people\u2014prefer to order their food via app, rather than using a web browser. It's okay if you launch your business without the app in place, but aim to get the app up and running within the first 6 months. Like the webpage, the app should allow customers to select their restaurant and food options, input a delivery address, and pay using a credit card. The Apple and Android app stores are the most popular, so start by making your app available on those markets. Let users download the app for free at first. Once your business starts turning a profit and becomes well known, you can charge for the app if you like.\n3. Establish pickup and delivery workflows for incoming orders. The workflow process should be streamlined and set in stone before you start taking orders. Once a customer places an order online, someone from your business will need to call the respective restaurant and place the order. Then, dispatch a driver to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. If the restaurants you're working with have sophisticated-enough computer systems, you may also be able to link their computers with the app and website directly. This will save you (or another employee) from having to relay customers' orders over the phone.\n4. Market your business through social media accounts. Social media is a great\u2014and free\u2014way to spread the word about your up-and-coming food-delivery business. Start with Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Reach out and like, follow, and friend people you know on all 3 platforms. Then, start posting! You can post pictures of your drivers, photos of tasty-looking meals, and screenshots of your website. Invite customers to leave positive reviews of your business in the \u201cComments\u201d section of Facebook and Instagram to build up your online credibility. You could also advertise your business in local papers, or create a radio ad to air on local stations.\n5. Advertise your business through flyers and physical mailers. Online advertising is great, but you should have physical ads as well. Print out flyers and staple or tape them to telephone poles throughout the neighborhoods you'd like to deliver food to. Also try plastering your company's logo all over your delivery containers and menus! Consider printing stickers that have your company's name or logo on them, and placing 1 or 2 in each delivery bag.\n6. Post ads at the locations of restaurants you've partnered with. As long as you're already in business with 2\u20133 restaurants around town, take advantage of their store space by putting up ads. For example, pin a few flyers on the store bulletin board. Or, ask the store if they can paint their windows to display your company's logo or name. You could even see if the store would be willing to pass out your fliers with every order they sell. Of course, make sure to get the store manager's permission before putting up any ads.\n7. Place advertisements in local community papers and newsletters. You want to get your company's advertisements in front of as many people's eyes as possible. Community newsletters and locally-circulated papers are great venues to use. They're cheaper to advertise in than widely-circulated papers. Plus, you can target your advertisements to the specific areas you'd like to deliver food to. For example, say you often deliver breakfasts and lunches to a large corporate campus. Reach out to the campus administrator and find out if they have an employee newsletter than you could place an ad in.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Information seeking,Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to write metal song lyrics?","response":"## Step\n\n1. Understand the meaning behind Metal Music. Metal is considered a \"counter-culture,\" meaning it opposes \"the normal, functional, and unexciting Culture that was dominant in society [and] by being outside of that which was in power, Counter-culturalists argued, they were able to see what was real.\" So when you before you begin writing, erase any preconceived notions that you have about a particular topic.\n2. Pick a topic. Metal music focuses on darker topics that match the heaviness of the music and skirt the \"popular\" beliefs of society. The topics often challenge the listeners' political, religious, emotional, philosophical, and\/or social beliefs. Select a topic that you have experience with or have a strong connection to, this is going to make the rest of the process much easier. Popular topics for metal songs include war, personal angst, mental disease, mythology, tragedy, death, hate, intolerance, corruption and love.\n3. Brainstorm the topic. Once you have selected the topic, you want to spend time formulating what your thoughts on the subject are. Unlike popular music, metal pulls from real \"truths\" rather than perceived \"morals\" or popular \"beliefs\" on the subject. Start with what is \"society's perspective.\" Think of what the culture promotes as the correct \"belief\" or \"moral\" in the discussion of that topic. It will be easier if you can find a belief that you find to be counter-intuitive, paradoxical or illogical such \"war for peace,\" \"religiously-motivated murder,\" or \"victim-blaming.\" Contrast that to examples based on experience. Take a real life, personal or a fictional example that challenges the mainstream beliefs behind this topic. How has your experience challenged society's view? Make note of any other arguments, perspectives, or facts surrounding this topic. What kind of things do people say about the subject? What promotes these beliefs? What are the consequences behind this ethical belief? Who does this affect? Find a \"truth\" within the topic. Based solely on the examples that challenge that perspective, what truths can you logically pull out? This truth will become the main thrust of your song.\n4. Start to weave together the basic parts of the song. Unlike other popular music, there is not a standard song format such as \"verse-chorus-verse-chorus.\" Instead, create your own structure based on the topic. Is there an important message that can be repeated?Do you want to provide the listener with a resolution? Here are some basic elements of the dramatic structure you can include:\n\t* \n\t* What is the rising action? What examples or personal experiences can you include to bring the listener to agree with your song's main \"truth\"? What is the climax? Can you create a moment where the listener can throw out the societal norms or absolute \"morals\" that they had? What is the resolution? What did these examples teach the listener? What did you learn?\n5. Develop and formulate the lyrical poem. Don't stick to \"rhyming patterns\" or \"rules behind poetry.\" Many popular metal songs don't necessarily rhyme or follow traditionally. Instead just weave together the basic parts you created in the last step. Tell your \"story\" to the listener.\n6. Consider finding a literary device(s) to add depth to the song. Literary devices that work particularly well in metal music include personification, allegories, figurative language, imagery, metaphors and synecdoches. Some helpful ways to find out what devices will work with your topic include:\n\t* What popular images are associated with that topic? (Metaphors, allegories, personification, synecdoches, etc.) What observations can you pull from this topic? (Imagery, etc.) Is there fiction or mythology that you can pull from? (Metaphors, allegories, etc.)\n7. Develop the sound to go with the lyrics. Use wikiHow to Write Power Metal Music to create the sound behind your lyrics.\n8. Come back to the song, and revise as necessary. Sometimes the music doesn't match up with the sound. So play the music and sing the lyrics to find where these inconsistencies are. Then edit either the music or the sound to fit the emotion behind what you are saying\/hearing.\n\n\n## Example: black sabbath's \"war pigs\"\n\n1. Black Sabbath set out to create Metal's counter-culture. Their fans were often disenfranchised youth who felt no connection to the free-love movement of the 1970s or the societal norms of the 1970s. They discussed topics that directly affected these youths and were relevant to what was going on in the world during that time.\n2. They choose the topic of war. This topic was perfect for the period where America used military force to achieve political change. In choosing this, they could speak out against the basic \"American\" beliefs behind the war effort. Societal beliefs: Society believed that war could bring peace. Experiences: War breeds more pain, suffering and destruction. Politicians start war, because they don't have to deal with those tragedies themselves. Other observations: It's the poor that fight, people die in masses, the generals guide soldier into certain death. The \"truth\": Politicians have the power and misuse it.\n3. Black Sabbath then started to weave together these basic ideas into the song, \"War Pigs\". They really focused less on rhyming and more on creating a vivid story with a rise, climax and a resolution. Rising Action: \"Generals gathered in their masses,\" \"In the fields the bodies burning,\" and \"Evil minds that plot destruction\" are all examples of realistic experiences and observations that Black Sabbath pulled from. Climax: \"Politicians hide themselves away\" and \"Wait 'til their judgement day comes\" support that from the examples, politicians will eventually be held responsible for what they did. Resolution: \"Now in darkness world stops turning,\" and \"No more war pigs have the power\" explain that eventually the people will rise up, and take back the power from the politicians. This provides a solution to the problems that existed in the rising action.\n4. Black Sabbath began to formulate these basic parts of the song together. Finding ways to make the lines fit together and to create a \"story.\" They tied the rising action to the climax with the \"oh lord yeah\" which foreshadows the resolution of judgement day.\n5. Literary devices were used to add depth to the song. Black Sabbath changed these experiences and facts surrounding war into something more meaningful and symbolic with literary devices. They weaved these ideas throughout the song, focusing on the main literary device of personification of \"war pigs.\" Popular images of \"tanks,\" \"machines,\" and \"battle fields\" are all references in the song. Observations like the masses being gathered and a chess game being played are also depicted. Fictitious and mythological images of \"sorcerers\" and \"witches\" are used in the song.\n","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Brainstorming,Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

While there is no way to increase your lung size, there are many ways to increase the amount of air your lungs take in, and the efficiency with which they capture oxygen. In particular, a rigorous exercise routine can help to strengthen your lungs and maximize their capacity to hold air. Do plenty of cardio. Incorporating some intense cardio workouts into your weekly routine can do wonders for your lungs. Running, skipping, aerobics and swimming are all great forms of cardiovascular exercise which get the blood pumping and the lungs working hard to supply the body with the oxygen it needs to keep going. Try doing exercising in intense 30 minute bursts, pushing your body to its limits, to achieve the best result. Exercise in water. Exercising in water (swimming, water aerobics, underwater weight training) is also a form of cardio exercise, but the water provides an element of resistance which requires the body to work harder to complete each task. As a result, the lungs need to work harder to supply the body with oxygen, causing their air capacity to increase significantly over time. Work-out at high elevation. At higher elevations, there is less oxygen in the air, meaning your lungs have to work harder to supply the body with oxygen. This is an excellent way to strengthen the lungs, but you must be careful not to train to hard, or you could potentially fall victim to altitude sickness.\n2. Lose weight. Any excess baggage reduces your body's efficiency in using oxygen, as there is increased body mass to which your blood must pump oxygen. As a result, many competitive breath holders will attempt to shed any extra pounds in the weeks coming up to a competition. This weight loss should be achieved in a strictly healthy way - through exercise and balanced diet - as weakening your body through crash dieting will negatively impact your ability to hold your breath. The world record breath holder, Aleix Segura Vendrell, is reported to have lost weight for 4 months before attempting to beat the world record for holding breath underwater, in an effort to improve his ratio of body volume to lung volume.\n3. Quit smoking. The fact that smoking has a negative impact on lung strength and capacity is common knowledge. Quitting can considerably increase your lungs' ability to release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen, even within a matter of weeks. So if you are trying to strengthen your lungs and increase their capacity, giving up smoking is undoubtedly the first thing on the to-do list. You should also try to avoid second-hand smoke as far as possible, as inhaling someone else's cigarette smoke can have a negative effect on your lungs.\n4. Take up a wind or brass instrument. These types of instruments require plenty of lung power, making them a great way to improve lung strength and increase your ability to control your breathing. And aside from that, playing an instrument is a fantastic life skill, which can provide immense personal satisfaction. The flute, clarinet, oboe and saxophone are all good options when it comes to wind instruments, while the trumpet, trombone and tuba are popular brass options. If you have a good voice, singing is another great musical aid to improving lung power. Singing requires immense control of one's breathing, making it an excellent complimentary activity for aspiring breath-holders.\n\n\n## Train techniques for hold your breath\n\n1. Practice deep breathing. Before holding your breath, inhale and exhale slowly from deep within your diaphragm. By doing this, you're ridding your lungs of low-quality air. Spend five seconds breathing in, then hold the breath for one second, before breathing out for ten seconds. Continue deep breathing for two minutes, and be sure that when you exhale, you push out every last \"drop\" of air. As you exhale, push your tongue up against your teeth.This forms a valve which helps to control the release of air. Your breath should make a hissing sound as it is released. Deep breathing allows your body to take in excess oxygen, which it can then store in the blood cells. This helps when holding your breath as your body can use the stored oxygen to continue functioning, even when you are not breathing.\n2. Purge the CO2 from your lungs. When holding your breath, the pressure you feel in your lungs is not the result of a need to breathe, but rather the result of a build-up of CO2, fighting to be released. This build-up of CO2 becomes increasingly painful as time goes on. To minimize this build-up, it is necessary to purge any pre-existing CO2 from your lungs, before holding your breath. To do this:\n\t* Exhale forcefully, pushing as much air out of your lungs as possible. Puff out your cheeks as you do this, and imagine you are trying to blow a toy sailboat across a stretch of water. Once you have exhaled completely, inhale quickly and repeat. Try to keep your body as still as possible while you do this, to avoid expending any of the stored oxygen from the previous step.\n3. Take a breath and hold it for one minute and thirty seconds. This is a practice run which will allow your body to adjust to the sensation of going without air. Use a timer to count down the 90 seconds, and don't attempt to hold your breath for any longer just yet. When you inhale, don't breathe in so much that you're about to pop; this creates tension in your body and causes you to expend more energy. Instead, fill your lung capacity to about 80-85% capacity so that you still have room to relax. Once the 90 seconds is up, exhale briefly to rid your lungs of the used air, then take three breaths, inhaling and exhaling fully. This is known as semi-purging.\n4. Repeat the process of deep breathing and purging, then hold your breath for two minutes and thirty seconds. Once the first 90 second practice run is up, repeat the deep breathing and purging exercises. Perform each exercise for a duration of one minute and thirty seconds. Once this is done, take a breath and hold it for two minutes and thirty seconds, timing it on a stopwatch. Do not attempt to hold your breath for any longer than this. Once the time is up, exhale to release the used air and take three semi-purge breaths. Follow this with two minutes of deep breathing and a minute and a half of purging. You are now ready to try holding your breath for as long as possible.\n5. Splash cold water on your face. At this point, you may decide to splash your face with some cold water before attempting to hold your breath. It has been observed that putting a person's face in contact with cold water triggers bradycardia, or the slowing of the heart rate, which is the first phase of the mammalian diving reflex. However, this step is purely optional. You don't need to actually put your entire head underwater, though. Just splash some cold water on your face right before you hold your breath, or try using a cold, wet washcloth. Don't use an ice pack instead of water, though; the same study suggests that the shock of something too cold triggers other reflexes. Just make sure the water is at a temperature of approximately 70 \u00b0F (21 \u00b0C) and that the rest of your body is in a relaxed position.\n6. Take a breath and hold it for as long as possible. Assume a comfortable seated position and take a deep breath, filling your lungs to about 80-85% of capacity. Hold your breath for as long as possible, staying completely still to avoid expending unnecessary energy and wasting oxygen. It is usually better to have someone else timing your progress, as time will pass more quickly and you will be able to hold your breath for longer if you are not constantly watching the clock. Holding your breath for long periods of time can be painful, and it usually necessary to find a way to distract yourself if you are to successfully achieve your goal. One popular distraction technique is to move through the alphabet from A to Z, thinking of a friend, celebrity or historical figure whose name begins with each letter. Aleix Segura Vendrell, who set a world record for holding his breath underwater for 24 minutes and 3 seconds, is a proponent of this very technique. Don't hold air in your cheeks. This method is meant for an air reserve, which requires \"letting go\" of the air in your lungs and switching it with the air in your cheeks. This is known as \"circular breathing\" and can be very difficult to achieve, usually resulting in the breath-holder losing both air reserves. Therefore, it may be best to avoid this method for the time being.\n7. Relax every muscle in your body. It is vital that you relax completely and release any tension from your body as you hold your breath. Close your eyes and focus on releasing the tension from each body part in turn, starting with your feet, and moving slowly upwards along your body, all the way up to your neck and head. By doing this, it is possible to significantly lower your heart rate and increase the time you are able to hold your breath for. Concentrate on something that's relaxing to you. When you can't concentrate anymore, distract yourself by doing something with your hands, like counting to 99 with your fingers. Try not to move during any point when holding your breath. When you move, you waste oxygen and that will cut down the time you're able to go without breathing. Stay still.\n8. Exhale slowly. When you can't hold your breath anymore, try to avoid exhaling all the air in your lungs in a mad rush. First, exhale about 20% of your air, then inhale again so that oxygen gets to your most critical areas faster. Then you can exhale and inhale completely.\n9. Repeat these steps 3-4 times per session. It is not recommended to do this any more, as it could damage your lungs and body. Try one session in the morning and one session at night if you wish. Keep practicing and before you know it, you will be able to hold your breath for several minutes.\n\n\n## Take the necessary safety precautions\n\n1. Always practice with a partner. It is highly advisable that you practice holding your breath with a partner. The main reason for this is that they can ensure your safety if you happen to pass out (which is fairly common during limit-testing training sessions), preventing you from hurting yourself and taking care of you while you recover your senses. In addition, a partner can help to time your breath-holding sessions, notifying you at each 30 second interval.\n2. Practice sitting up, rather than lying down. The best position to practice holding your breath in is sitting upright in a comfortable position, such as on a sofa or armchair. This allows you to expend as little energy as possible while holding your breath. It is not advised that you lie down while holding your breath, as you run the risk of choking on your tongue if you happen to pass out.\n3. Do not attempt to do this underwater, unless supervised by a professional. Although the purpose of learning to hold your breath for longer is usually for use underwater, you should never do underwater training alone, without supervision. As mentioned before, it is quite common for people to black out or lose consciousness after holding their breath for prolonged periods, and if this happens underwater it can lead to drowning. Even practicing with a partner can be dangerous, as an untrained eye may be unable to tell the difference between someone who is holding their breath and someone who has passed out. If you do decide to practice with a partner, make sure that you decide on a hand signal which you can give at regular intervals to indicate to your partner that you are okay.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to claim tax back?","response":"Typically you pay taxes on your income throughout the year \u2013 but over the course of a year, your life may change drastically. You may lose your job, get a new job that pays less money, get married, have a child, or buy a house. As a result of any of these changes, you may find that you've paid too much in taxes. When you pay too much, you typically are entitled to a refund. In most countries, you must file a return to claim tax back.\n\n## Take deductions and credit\n\n1. Report major life changes. Getting married, having a child, or buying a house are examples of positive life changes that can mean you don't owe as much tax. Negative changes, such as losing your job or getting a divorce, may have the same result. You also may be entitled to a tax refund if your residency status has changed. For example, non-residents may pay a higher tax rate than residents. If you become a permanent resident during the tax year, you may be able to get some of those higher taxes back. The government typically doesn't automatically make these changes for you and reassess your tax liability. Instead, you have to report the change and claim a refund for the amount you overpaid.\n2. Keep records of medical expenses. If you have medical expenses that weren't covered by insurance, you may be able to deduct some or all of those expenses on your taxes. Save your receipts so you have them at year's end. This typically only applies to bills you've actually paid. For example, if you have a $12,000 hospital bill for emergency treatment and you've only paid half of it so far, you could only deduct that half you paid. In the following year, you could potentially deduct the other half.\n3. Claim payment of interest. Certain types of interest, such as interest on a mortgage or on student loans, often can be deducted from your income on your taxes. After you make this deduction, you may be eligible to claim tax back. For example, in the U.S. you can get a credit for at least a portion of the interest you paid on your student loans. When you claim a credit, the government treats it as though you'd actually paid that money on your taxes, which could result in you getting a refund.\n4. Complete the appropriate forms. If you plan to claim any deductions or credits, you typically must file a tax return that allows you to itemize. Even if you typically don't have to file a return each year, you'll need one if you want to claim tax back. For example, taxes in the UK typically are automatically reconciled. If you're employed and earn an hourly wage or a salary, you shouldn't have to file a return. But if you want to claim deductions or credits, you may have to file a return to get that tax back that you overpaid.\n5. Provide proof that you are entitled to the credit or deduction. In many cases, if you're claiming a credit or deduction on your taxes, you must be able to prove that you actually incurred that expense. Even if you aren't required to submit this proof, you should still keep it in your records in case your return is audited. For example, if you or someone in your household is disabled, you may be eligible to take the disability tax credit. However, before you can claim this credit you need a letter from a doctor certifying the disability.\n6. Submit your return by the deadline. Your government may have strict deadlines by which you must file a return if you are requesting a refund. In some countries, the government will pay you interest on the amount of tax you overpaid, provided a deadline is met. While most governments will give you a few years to request a refund of overpaid taxes, the process may be more cumbersome if you wait. File your tax return as soon as possible if you're due a refund, so you can get your money back.\n\n\n## Report business expense\n\n1. Keep records throughout the year. If you're self-employed or own your own business, you can deduct your business expenses from the money you earn throughout the year. Even if you work for a salary or hourly wage, you still may be able to deduct work-related expenses. If you buy anything for work purposes, keep the receipt. You can also use a bookkeeping or personal finance app to help you keep track throughout the year.\n2. Review expenses you can deduct. Your government's tax department should have a list of the types of expenses you can deduct from your income. If you have significant business expenses, you may want to consult a professional tax advisor or accountant. To deduct a business expense, you generally must be able to prove that it was related to your work, and that you paid for it yourself. You can't deduct expenses that your employer reimbursed. If your employer reimbursed you for part of the expense, though, you may be able to deduct the portion that wasn't reimbursed. Talk to a tax advisor about certain expenses, such as travel expenses. These may not be entirely deductible.\n3. Use the appropriate tax return form. If you have expenses related to self-employment, you typically must fill out a separate form for the income you have related to that self-employment. Your business expenses are deductible from that income. For example, suppose you have a day job that pays you an hourly wage, and you also occasionally give people rides through a ride-share app. You would be required to report your income from ride-sharing on your taxes, but you could deduct any related expenses. This could include a portion of your car payment and car insurance.\n4. Submit your tax returns. To deduct business expenses on your taxes, you must submit your yearly tax return. In some cases, you may be required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year if your income from self-employment is over a certain amount set by your government. If you have significant business expenses, it may take you a little longer to complete your return, so don't wait until the last minute.\n5. Keep receipts for expenses you deducted. You typically don't have to provide the receipts or proof of your business expenses to the government when you submit your tax returns. However, if your return is audited, you must be able to produce this documentation. Generally, you want to keep these records for at least 4 or 5 years. Check with your government's tax department to find out how far back returns can be audited, and make sure you're keeping your records for at least that long, just in case.\n\n\n## Adjust your withhold\n\n1. Check the withholding on your paycheck. Especially if you've recently started a new job, you may find that too much money is being withheld from your paycheck for taxes. Check your pay stub or talk to someone in your employer's payroll department to find out how withholding is computed. It's generally a good idea to revisit the amount being withheld from your paycheck for taxes whenever you have a major life change that you would report on your taxes. Major life changes that could potentially affect your tax liability include getting a second job, being unemployed for any period of time, getting married or divorced, or having a child.\n2. Determine your appropriate tax bracket. If your overall household income has changed for any reason, there may be too much tax withheld from your paycheck. Estimate your tax liability for the year and compare it to your government's tax scheme. If you live in the U.S., you can do this fairly easily in most cases by filling out a new W-4. If the result is different from the one you have on file with your employer, your employer should update their records.\n3. Complete new withholding forms. You may be able to submit changes to your withholding online, or you may have to fill out new paper forms with your employer's payroll department. Speak to a manager or someone in human resources and let them know you need to make this change.\n4. Verify the change has been made. Once your withholding has been adjusted, you should notice that less money is being taken out of each paycheck. If the amount being withheld hasn't changed, get back to someone in payroll. Some countries, such as the UK, may issue you a refund directly through your employer if you overpaid on taxes throughout the year.\n","primary_tag":"Information

{"instruction":"How to get over a break up fast?","response":"Dealing with a breakup can be very difficult, whether you ended it or they did. Fortunately, things will get better! You can get over your breakup faster by boosting your mood with fun activities and small indulgences. Additionally, use healthy coping strategies to deal with your feelings. As soon as you can, start taking steps to move on with your life.\n\n## Boost your mood\n\n1. Distract yourself with activities that make you feel good. Indulging in distractions is a quick and easy way to make yourself feel good after a breakup. Although it won\u2019t help you overcome your feelings in the long term, a distraction helps you temporarily escape your heartache and feel better while you cope with your feelings. Here are some ways you could temporarily distract yourself from the breakup:\n\t* Engage in your favorite hobby\n\t* Draw or paint something\n\t* Bake treats for your friends\n\t* Join a few friends for a pick up game of baseball, basketball, or football\n\t* Go for a hike\n\t* Browse your favorite shops\n\t* Host a game night with your friends\n\t* See a funny movie\n2. Spend time with friends and family who make you feel good. Being around your biggest supporters can help improve your mood because it will remind you how much you're loved. Plus, you can enjoy fun times with people who aren't your ex, which helps you move past the breakup. If you don't feel up to going out yet, invite friends or family members to enjoy a meal, movie, or game night at your home. You might watch your favorite comedies and order a pizza or play your favorite board games. If you feel like going out, ask a friend to meet you for coffee, plan a fun night out with your friends, or invite friends to go see a movie. As another option, choose an activity that gets you moving, like playing miniature golf, bowling, or walking in a local park.\n3. Fill your schedule so you have less time to dwell on the breakup. Keeping yourself busy gives you less time to think about the breakup. This lessens how much you experience your negative emotions. Go to school or work, volunteer, catch up on errands, help out your friends or relatives, or take up a new hobby. Not only will your mind be off your breakup, but you\u2019ll also be helping both yourself and others. For example, you could fill up your free time by enrolling in an art class, volunteering to care for dogs at the local shelter, and helping your grandmother do her weekly grocery shopping. You\u2019ll get to meet new people, make a difference, and assist a loved one while also having a little fun.\n4. Date yourself by doing fun things your former partner never did with you. Make a list of things you\u2019ve always wanted your partner to do with you, like dancing, going to an art opening, seeing your favorite sports team play a game, or trying a new restaurant. Now that you\u2019re single, take yourself on these \u201cdates.\u201d Doing what you enjoy will help you feel better quickly, plus you\u2019ll see how much better your life can be now. For example, you might see a movie your ex would never watch or go on an outdoor adventure your homebody ex thought would be boring. It\u2019s okay to also invite friends to go with you, but commit to going alone if no one is available to go with you.\n5. Indulge yourself with your favorite treat, a special gift, or a day of pampering. Doing something nice for yourself will help put you in a good mood. Choose something you really want or enjoy. Then, spend a few days indulging your desires. If you can spare the money, make yourself a treat care package or buy yourself something nice. If you\u2019re short on money, try budget ways of pampering yourself, like making a homemade facial mask, taking a hot bath, baking yourself a batch of cookies, going for a walk in the park, or borrowing a movie or game from a friend.\n6. Repeat a positive affirmation that makes you feel better. Affirmations can help you boost your mood if you believe them, so choose an affirmation that resonates with you. Focus on a positive statement that both feels accurate to you and lifts your spirit. Repeat your affirmation whenever you\u2019re feeling down. Here are some examples of positive affirmations:\n\t* \u201cI am worthy of love.\u201d\n\t* \u201cI get validation from myself, not someone else.\u201d\n\t* \u201cI will live my best life.\u201d\n\t* \u201cI am the only one who can make me happy, so I will.\u201d\n\t* \u201cI am a strong, beautiful person.\u201d\n\n\n## Cop with your feel\n\n1. Acknowledge the emotions you\u2019re feeling without judging yourself. It\u2019s normal to feel a range of emotions after a breakup. You\u2019ll likely feel sad or angry, but it\u2019s also possible you\u2019ll feel love for your ex. Don\u2019t try to make yourself stop feeling these emotions. Instead, recognize what you\u2019re feeling, acknowledge it, then let it pass. Accepting your emotions like this will help you get through them more quickly. You\u2019ll also experience less emotional pain. For example, you might say to yourself, \u201cI still feel love for Alex. We dated for a year, so I know this is normal.\u201d Similarly, you might tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019m feeling really sad and betrayed right now. I have a right to feel this way.\u201d\n2. Share your feelings with someone you trust. Talk to a friend or relative who won\u2019t judge you. Tell them what you\u2019ve been going through, and let their responses help you feel better about yourself. Rely on your closest relationships to help you get through the breakup. Choose a few trusted individuals you can talk to so you\u2019ll have several options when you need to talk. That way, you\u2019ll still have someone to turn to if one friend is busy. If you don\u2019t feel like you have someone you can trust, try talking to a counselor or therapist. They can help you work through your feelings in a healthy way.\n3. Write a journal entry about the breakup and how it\u2019s made you feel. Writing about what happened and how you feel can help you get over the breakup faster. Additionally, writing about your goals for the future and how well you are doing can help you direct your attention forward rather than on the past. This is a great way to deal with your feelings if you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing with others. If your ex really hurt you, write a letter to them telling them how it made you feel. Then, burn or rip up the letter instead of sending it. This can help you release those feelings in a healthy way.\n4. List your ex\u2019s negative traits to help you get over them quickly. Recognizing the flaws in your ex, especially when it came to your relationship, can help you love them less. It helps you let go of your image of them as your partner so you can accept the breakup. While noticing their unfavorable traits or habits will help you get over them fast, it might make you feel sad while you\u2019re doing it. For instance, you might make a list like this one: \u201c1) Doesn\u2019t text me back right away; 2) Talks badly about my sister; 3) Forgot my birthday last year; 4) Eats all of my snacks but never replaces them; 5) Hates cats.\u201d\n5. Allow yourself to cry if you feel like it. It\u2019s normal and healthy to cry after a breakup, especially in the first few days. Crying it out can even help you get over your breakup faster, so don\u2019t fight off those tears. Release them, and the urge to cry will eventually pass. If crying in front of others bothers you, go to a place where you can be alone. This might be your bedroom, a bathroom, or a safe place outside. If you share a room, ask the other person if they will give you a few minutes alone.\n\n\n## Move on with your life\n\n1. Spend some time getting to know yourself before dating again. It\u2019s normal to lose yourself in a relationship, so give yourself time to remember who you are as an individual. Think about what you really want in life, as well as what you want in a partner. Additionally, try out different activities to figure out how you enjoy living your life. Not only will this help you get over your breakup more quickly, it\u2019ll also help you form a healthier relationship with your next partner.\n2. Take good care of yourself by sleeping more, eating well, and exercising. This helps you feel better and reduces your stress. Additionally, you\u2019ll be able to keep your life moving forward instead of falling into bad habits. Here\u2019s how to keep your health on track:\n\t* Create a bedtime routine to help you go to sleep earlier. Turn down your thermostat, turn off your screens, and spend an hour relaxing before bed. Base your meals around lean proteins and vegetables, and snack on fruit, nuts or low-fat dairy. Additionally, drink plenty of water. Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. Go for a walk, run, dance, do aerobics, or take a gym class.\n3. Block your ex on all of your social media accounts. Keeping up with what your ex is doing will keep you trapped in the past. Don\u2019t hold onto the relationship once it\u2019s over. Focus on living your own life without worrying about what they\u2019re doing. You might feel tempted to leave them on your social media accounts so you can show them how well your life is going. Although that might seem satisfying, it\u2019s actually counterproductive because it keeps your thoughts on them. Just let them go. If you have mutual friends with your ex, consider temporarily unfollowing them if you know they\u2019ll be posting about your ex.\n4. Clear out all items that remind you of them. Return any items they left at your home, and donate any gifts you don\u2019t want anymore. Next, throw away or recycle any items that can\u2019t be donated, like cards or uneaten candy. Then, put away photos and momentos you might want later. This will keep your mind off your ex so you can focus on the future. You don\u2019t have to get rid of everything they gave you or every memory you made together. Use your best judgement when deciding what to keep. If it doesn\u2019t remind you of them, you might choose to keep it. Similarly, you might put away photos of you with them until a later time when the breakup no longer bothers you.\n5. Focus on your personal goals to positively direct your attention. Choose a goal you hope to accomplish, like writing a book, getting picked for a sports team, or getting a promotion at work.

{"instruction":"How to thicken facial hair?","response":"If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the patchiness of your beard or mustache, there are several easy steps you can take to thicken your facial hair. Many of these involve making simple lifestyle changes, like changing your diet or exercising more. If these easy techniques don\u2019t give you the results you\u2019re looking for, there are several products you can try out, which may either make your beard thicker or make it appear so. If these don\u2019t work and you really want fuller facial hair, there\u2019s always the option of getting a beard transplant.\n\n## Make lifestyle change\n\n1. Eat a healthy diet to get the vitamins and nutrients your beard needs. Like any other part of your body, your beard needs vitamins and nutrients to grow properly. Be sure your diet includes a balanced mix of whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables. Remember to also drink plenty of water and other fluids to stay hydrated. Since your hair is protein-based, it\u2019s especially important that you eat plenty of protein. Sources of protein include: lean meats, eggs, dairy products, beans, legumes, seeds, and nuts. Adult men should aim to consume around 0.84 grams (0.030 oz) of protein per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of body weight.\n2. Exercise to help stimulate hair growth. Being physically active on a regular basis will help boost your blood circulation. Better blood circulation will allow more nutrients to reach your hair roots, helping to boost hair growth. Try to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise every day by jogging, taking a brisk walk, or riding a bike. If you don\u2019t exercise much, ease into an exercise regime gradually so that you don\u2019t injure yourself.\n3. Reduce stress in your life to keep your hair healthy. Constant, high levels of stress can make your hair more brittle and even cause it to fall out. You can minimize stress in your life by getting enough sleep every night, exercising regularly, and participating in relaxing activities. Aim to get between 8-10 hours of sleep a night if you\u2019re a teenager, and at least 7 hours of sleep if you\u2019re over 18 years of age. Activities like yoga, meditation, and reading can also help you relax.\n\n\n## Take care of your facial hair\n\n1. Let your beard grow for at least 4 weeks. You\u2019ll need to let your facial hair grow out a while before you can determine just how thick it looks. While your beard may look patchy and uneven after a week of letting it grow out, after 4 weeks, it may actually look lush and full. Try not to start trimming your beard too soon. Don\u2019t trim any hair until you reach the 3rd week or so. Itchiness usually fades after the 2nd week of growing out your facial hair.\n2. Comb and brush your facial hair to cover patchy spots. As you let your facial hair grow out, comb and brush it daily. Comb areas that are thicker towards the patchier areas you want to cover. This will help train the hairs to grow in that direction. If you plan to keep a beard long term, consider investing in a quality beard brush.\n3. Apply a beard oil to your beard to soften and nourish it. In addition to eating a healthy and well-balanced diet, using beard oil is another great way to supply your beard with the vitamins and nutrients it needs to look full and healthy. Apply beard oil to your facial hair once a day to begin with. Apply your beard oil soon after you get out of the shower, when your beard is still slightly damp, but not dripping wet. Beard oil will also help reduce the itchiness of your facial hair during the first 2 weeks of growth.\n\n\n## Use hair-growth products\n\n1. Dye your facial hair to make it look thicker. If some of your facial hairs are blond, light brown, or gray, your facial hair may look thinner and patchier than it really is. Dyeing your facial hair a darker color will make these hairs more visible, making your beard or mustache look fuller and more uniform. You can find hair dye made for coloring facial hair at your local drug store. When dyeing your facial hair, follow the directions on the container closely, so you don\u2019t end up with dye spots on your skin.\n2. Take biotin supplements daily to thicken your facial hair. Biotin supplements may help thicken your facial hair by strengthening your hair\u2019s keratin infrastructure, giving your facial hair a fuller appearance. You can find biotin supplements over-the-counter at your local drug store. Biotin supplements, unfortunately, won\u2019t make hair grow in places where there isn\u2019t any to begin with. Products marketed as beard-growing pills are usually a combination of biotin, vitamin C, zinc, and other vitamins. The claims of these and other supplements haven\u2019t been proven in clinical trials, so take them with a hefty grain of salt.\n3. Apply Minoxidil (aka Rogaine) to your facial hair. Minoxidil helps stimulates blood circulation, which allows more nutrients and hormones to reach your hair follicles. This helps encourage growth of your hair. You can buy Minoxidil as a foam or liquid. You can purchase Minoxidil at your local drug store. The 2 most common side-effects users of Minoxidil experience are lower blood pressure and dry, irritated skin.\n4. Look into getting a beard transplant if other methods don\u2019t work. A beard transplant involves a doctor taking hairs from the back of your scalp and transferring them to areas on your face where you want thicker hair. After the procedure, it may take a few months for you to see its final results. The procedure typically takes several hours and requires the application of a local anesthetic. A beard transplant can cost upwards of $7,000.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to identify ticks?","response":"While tick bites are not often painful, they can lead to infections or even chronic illnesses like Lyme disease. If you're uncertain whether you're dealing with a tick infestation, check for defining features that distinguish a tick from other bugs. Some bugs that look like ticks are harmless, but ticks must be dealt with immediately to avoid illness or infection. Call an exterminator if you're still not sure for a professional opinion.\n\n## Check for distinctive tick feature\n\n1. Look for a round, ovular shape. Before a tick is engorged with blood, its body is shaped like an oval with 2 major segments. After a tick is engorged, its head will remain small but its body will grow round and plump.\n2. Check for bugs that are between \u20442 to 2 in (1.3 to 5.1 cm) long. How large a tick is when you find it depends on whether it has recently fed on blood. Before it has drunk any blood, a tick will be around the size of a pinhead. Immediately to several hours afterward, a tick will grow to around the size of a lima bean.\n3. Examine its exterior for a protective hard body. In most cases, ticks have a hard exoskeleton. These are called hard or \"authentic\" ticks and are usually what people are talking about when describing ticks. Soft ticks with a flexible exoskeleton exist but are only found in select areas. Soft ticks are found in the western United States and southwestern Canada.\n4. Check for a star-shaped design on its back. Lone star ticks have a white, star-shaped design on their exoskeletons. If a bug does not have this design, it still may be a tick. This pattern is just a defining feature of this tick species.\n5. Examine the bug for black legs. Black-legged ticks, as suggested by their name, have legs that are darker than their bodies. Like a lone star tick's black legs, this is a defining characteristic of black-legged ticks and may not be present on every tick.\n\n\n## Differentiate between tick and other bug\n\n1. Avoid mistaking bugs with wings or antennae for ticks. Ticks do not have wings, nor do they have antennae. If you have found a bug with either, it is not a tick. Research bugs with similar characteristics to ticks but with wings or antennae if your bug in question has these. Poplar weevils, which are commonly mistaken for ticks, have both wings and antennae.\n2. Count the number of legs to distinguish it from insects. Because ticks are a type of arachnid, like spiders and scorpions, they have 8 legs. If your bug has 6, it is an insect and therefore not a tick. If your bug has less than 6 or more than 8 legs, it is neither an insect nor arachnid but is, regardless, not a tick.\n3. Watch for bugs that feed on blood and do not travel in groups. Billbugs are the commonly mistaken for ticks because of their near-identical appearance. The way to distinguish between a tick and a billbug is to watch them. Billbugs swarm in groups, whereas ticks are usually alone. Ticks also feed on blood, whereas billbugs do not. As a general rule, billbugs do not hang around or on people and animals. Ticks often do.\n4. Look for bugs that burrow in the skin instead of resting on its surface. Both ticks and bed bugs hang around animals and humans. Their method of feeding off of people and animals, however, differs. Ticks burrow into the skin to drink a living creature's blood but bed bugs stay on the skin's surface. Make sure you know whether a bug is a tick or bed bug before removing it from your skin. Without proper precautions, you may remove a tick's body while its head remains lodged in your skin.\n\n\n## Identify tick bite\n\n1. Check for mild pain around the bite. Tick bites are not usually painful. If you experience sharp pain, you have not likely been bitten by a tick. Research your other symptoms to determine what insect or arachnid bit you and begin treatment. If a soft tick bites you, you might notice localized pain immediately after the tick drops off.\n2. Inspect the site for redness. Although tick bites are not painful, they can still set off your body's immune system. If the bite and the skin surrounding it looks reddish, it may be a tick bite. Keep in mind, however, that redness is a symptom of many bug bites.\n3. Watch for rash development in the days and weeks following your bite. While not often a symptom of tick bites, you may develop a rash if your tick bite becomes infected or if you contracted an illness from the tick bite. If a rash spreads from your tick bite to other parts of your body, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic. Some illnesses that ticks carry, like Lyme disease, can take months or years before symptoms develop.\n4. Look for a tick still attached to your body. Because tick bites usually do not hurt, the most common way to spot a tick bite is to see the tick burrowed in your skin. Compare the bug on your body to other insects before removing it so you can use a pair of tweezers or a credit card to safely get it out of your skin. If you are not careful, tick heads can remain lodged in your skin.\n5. Recognize tick bite symptoms that require immediate medical care. While most tick bites can be treated at home, you may need emergency care if you develop an infection or allergic reaction. Seek emergency medical help immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:\n\t* Raised red bumps (hives) all over your body\n\t* Trouble breathing\n\t* Swelling of the mouth, lips, tongue, or throat\n\t* Lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Tick bites are not often

{"instruction":"How to make popcorn balls?","response":"Popcorn balls are a classic treat, typically sold in carnivals and occasionally the supermarket. What's even better, however, are homemade popcorn balls. Not only are they made using the freshest ingredients, but you can also choose what goes into theme. You can make the classic marshmallow type, but you can also make them with caramel or even peanut butter! Whichever one you choose to make, you are bound to end up with something tasty!\n\n## Make marshmallow popcorn ball\n\n1. Bring the light corn syrup, butter, water, confectioners' sugar, and marshmallows to a boil over medium heat. Pour the light corn syrup into a saucepan, then stir in the butter, water, confectioners' sugar, and marshmallows.

You can use pre-popped popcorn from the store, or you can make your own using a stove or microwave.\n5. Coat your hands with butter, then sculpt the popcorn into 3\u00bd-inch (8.89-centimeter) balls. Place the popcorn balls onto a baking sheet covered with wax paper as you finish each one. You can also use a greased cupcake or muffin pan instead.\n6. Wait for the popcorn to set. This will take about 30 minutes. After this, you can serve the popcorn balls however you please.\n\n\n## Make peanut butter popcorn ball\n\n1. Bring the brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter to a boil over medium heat. Put the brown sugar into a large saucepan, then stir in the corn syrup and butter. Put the saucepan on the stove, then turn the heat up to medium. Wait for the mixture to come to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.\n2. Take the saucepan off the stove, then stir in the peanut butter. As soon as the mixture comes to a boil, take the saucepan off the burner and add the peanut butter. Stir well with a rubber spatula until everything is evenly combined. Make sure that you use the plain kind of peanut butter.\n3. Place the popcorn into a large bowl, then pour the mixture over it. Stir the two together with a rubber spatula until everything is evenly coated. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often! You can use pre-popped popcorn from the store, or make your own ahead of time using a microwave or stove.\n4. Coat your hands with butter or vegetable shortening, then form the popcorn into balls. Try to get the balls about 3\u00bd inches (8.89 centimeters) wide. As you finish the balls, place them onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper. You can also use a greased cupcake or muffin pan instead.\n5. Wait for the popcorn to set. This will take about 30 minutes. After that, you can serve the popcorn balls.\n6.

{"instruction":"How to ride the london eye?","response":"The London Eye is an iconic part of London\u2019s cityscape. It\u2019s a giant ferris wheel, built in 2000 to commemorate the new millennium. It\u2019s made up of 32 large glass capsules that move slowly, allowing riders to get a great view London\u2019s most famous sights. To ride the London Eye, you\u2019ll need to find your way there, find the right package for your needs, and know some of its security and logistical characteristics.\n\n## Book your ride on the london eye\n\n1. Choose your package. The London Eye offers a variety of experiences at different prices. Standard tickets put you in a capsule with around 20 other people, where you can ride the Eye for about 30 minutes. There are quite a few packages beyond the standard ticket, including:\n\t* Fast track tickets, which let you jump ahead of the queue and board the Eye more quickly. Flexi tickets let you visit the London Eye at any time of day rather than booking a specific time in advance. Combination packages let you save money by combining London Eye tickets with passes for other London attractions, such as the London Dungeon or Madame Tussauds.\n2. Book your ticket online. Visiting the London Eye\u2019s official website will let you buy your ticket ahead of time, saving a bit of wait time. Additionally, you\u2019ll be able to save 10% on the ticket price by paying online. After choosing your package, you\u2019ll be able to pay online with a credit card or PayPal. After buying your ticket, you\u2019ll have the option to print your ticket at home or collect it at the London Eye. The former will save you more wait time.\n3. Pay on the spot. While it\u2019s more convenient to book tickets online, it\u2019s also possible to queue up at the London Eye for your ticket. You\u2019ll have directions on site as to where to line up to buy your ticket. Note that while this is possible, it\u2019s usually best to pre book for the London Eye, especially with more exclusive packages.\n\n\n## Find your way to the london eye\n\n1. Take the tube or train. There are a few train stations near the London Eye, which are accessible by train or by using the subway. The closest station is Waterloo, which is about a five minute walk from the London Eye if you follow signs for the South Bank. Alternatively, you can reach the London Eye from the Embankment and Charing Cross stations; you\u2019ll need to cross the Hungerford Bridge to reach the London Eye from these stations.\n2. Get on the bus. There are three bus lines that can take you directly to Waterloo station, close to the London Eye. The bus line you take depends on your starting point. The 211 bus line travels between Hammersmith Bus Station and the Waterloo station. The 77 line also has its final stop at Waterloo station, although it starts from Tooting Station. The 381 is your last option, and starts from Peckham Bus Station.\n3. Take a taxi. The fare will vary depending on where you\u2019re leaving from, but the London Eye has a dedicated drop off location for taxis at the end of its landscape. They also tend to congregate there, ready to take you back to a hotel or to your next destination. If you opt for using Uber instead of a taxi, you\u2019re usually looking at a minimum fare of \u00a314, ($18.13) with rates of \u00a30.08 ($0.10) per minute and \u00a30.75 ($0.97) per mile.\n4. Park your car at Q-Park Westminster car park. Whether you\u2019re picking up a rental car or driving with a local, this is the best place to park and the London Eye can get you a 15% discount. From there, it\u2019s a 5 minute walk to the London Eye, across either the Westminster Bridge or Lambeth Bridge. Note that the London Eye is situated in the London Congestion Zone. This means you\u2019ll be charged \u00a311.50 ($14.89) for driving to the London Eye on a weekday between 7am and 6pm.\n\n\n## Get on the eye\n\n1. Know what you can and can\u2019t take with you. The London Eye has an important list of restricted items. Many of these will be taken from you at a security check before entry, and returned to you once you disembark. This list includes, but is not limited to:\n\t* Sharp objects, from knives to nail files. Replica or toy guns. Large bags or rucksacks. Skateboards and rollerblades.\n2. Prepare to wait in line. It can take at least 45 minutes to board the London Eye, with wait times increasing during peak times, especially on weekends and holidays. It\u2019s suggested that you arrive at least 30 minutes before your booked time; this will allow you sufficient time to collect your tickets and join the queue. If you have a standard entry, you\u2019ll enter the capsule through the standard queue. The Fast Track queue can only be accessed if you have a Fast Track ticket and allows for shorter queue times.\n3. Move about the capsule for the best view. The London Eye capsules offer a full 360 degree view, and it moves slowly enough to guarantee a you\u2019ll catch all of London\u2019s sights. While the capsule can hold up to 28 people, you should still be able to move around and get a good view. The ride takes about 30 minutes, so make sure to keep your eyes open.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"It is a giant ferris

{"instruction":"How to safely cook chicken from frozen?","response":"If you are in a rush, you may not have the time to thaw chicken for a meal. Luckily, you can save yourself some time and safely cook chicken from frozen. You can roast a whole, frozen chicken for a large group, or bake breasts or drumsticks for a smaller meal. Regardless of how much chicken you cook, it is important to always follow the safety guidelines for cooking chicken and thoroughly cook your meat to avoid any foodborne illnesses.\n\n## Roast a whole chicken from freeze\n\n1. Use caution when cooking frozen chicken. If you are cooking any parts of a chicken from frozen, there is an increased risk for foodborne illness. To kill any pathogens in the chicken, be sure to cook the meat to an internal temperature of at least 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Always prepare from frozen chicken in the oven or on the stovetop and, as a rule of thumb, cook it about 50 percent longer than you would thawed meat. For example, it would take about two hours to roast a thawed 5-pound (2.25 kg) roasting hen at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). If frozen, a similarly sized chicken would take about three hours to cook thoroughly at the same temperature. Check the internal temperature of the meat by inserting a meat thermometer into thickest part of the breast and the innermost part of the thigh and wing. If the thermometer does not ready 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), continue cooking the bird. Do not try to cook the frozen chicken in a slow cooker. The appliance will not get hot enough to kill the pathogens in the meat. It also leaves the meat sitting for too long at unsafe temperatures.\n2. Preheat the oven. Turn on your oven and heat it to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). While your oven warms up, put the frozen chicken breast-side-up in a large roasting pan. This will ensure that the densest meat of the bird gets thoroughly cooked. Depending on the size of the chicken, you may also be able to use a Dutch oven instead of a roasting pan.\n3. Dress the chicken. If the bird is not frozen closed, try to remove the giblets from inside of the chicken. Once you remove the giblets, stuff the bird with your favorite ingredients, such as lemon, onion, rosemary, and thyme. Then rub the exterior of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. If you cannot access the inside of the bird, wait until it has cooked for about 45 minutes to remove the giblets. Use tongs and an oven mitt to remove the giblets and insert any stuffings that you want.\n4. Cook the chicken. Place the seasoned chicken in the oven uncovered and roast for about 90 minutes. Then increase the temperature of the oven to 450\u00baF (232\u00baC) and cook the chicken for another 15 to 30 minutes. This will help brown the skin. Remove the pan from the oven and serve once a meat thermometer placed into various parts of the chicken reads 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). These cooking times are based on a 4-pound (1.8 kg) chicken. Be sure to adjust the roasting time based on the weight of your chicken. Let the chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes to cool before carving. If there is any pink or red meat, place the whole bird or uncooked pieces back in the oven until they turn white and there is no red in the juices.\n\n\n## Prepare bread chicken breast from freeze\n\n1. Freeze the breasts individually. When you bring the chicken breasts home from the grocery store, place them in single layer in a freezer bag. Make sure that there is some space between the breasts. If they freeze together, it will be hard to separate them and you will likely have to thaw them. You can also freeze the breasts flat on a plate or tray and then transfer them to a freezer bag. This is a good strategy for freezing any individual chicken parts.\n2. Preheat the oven. Preheat your oven to 425\u00baF (218\u00baC). While the oven warms, lightly oil a baking sheet. You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other preferred cooking oil or fat. Then place four boneless skinless chicken breasts on the tray. If you are cooking frozen chicken breasts without breading, preheat the oven to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC).\n3. Add breading. As the oven warms, mix 1\/3-cup (113 g) dry breadcrumbs, \u00bd-teaspoon (3 g) salt, \u00bc-teaspoon (1.5 g) of black pepper, \u00bc-teaspoon (1.5 g) garlic powder with one tablespoon (15 ml) of cooking oil. Spread about one teaspoon (5 ml) of mustard on the top of the frozen chicken breasts. Then sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture onto the breasts, making sure that the mix sticks to the mustard.\n4. Bake the breasts. Place the tray in the oven and cook the breasts for about 30 to 40 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast to make sure that it is cooked thoroughly. If the temperature is below 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear. If you are cooking four frozen 4-oz (28 g) chicken breasts without any breading, you should cook them at 350\u00baF (177\u00baC) for 30 to 45 minutes. However, it is important to remember that the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts.\n\n\n## Bake freeze chicken legs\n\n1. Season the legs before freezing. Because it is difficult to get seasoning to stick to frozen chicken skin, it may be easier to season your drumsticks before freezing them. Before you put them in the freezer, coat your drumsticks with your desired seasoning or rub. This will freeze the seasoning to the skin and make it easier to pull the legs from the freezer and toss them in the oven when you are ready to cook. This is a great way to season any individual pieces of chicken before you freeze them.\n2. Preheat the oven. Heat the oven to 350\u00baF (177\u00baC). While the oven warms, remove your drumsticks from the freezer and place them on a tray. For a side, you may also want to add some chopped vegetables like carrots and onions or a few sliced potatoes to the tray.\n3. Cook the drumsticks. Place the tray in the oven and cook the drumsticks for about 50 to 60 minutes. Once the time is up, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the drumstick to make sure that it is cooked. If the temperature is below 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear. When you are taking the temperature of the drumsticks, try not to touch the bone with your thermometer. This will give you an inaccurate temperature.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"You can roast a whole, frozen

{"instruction":"How to make your linkedin profile stand out?","response":"LinkedIn has become a key tool for many recruiters to search for qualified candidates and for job seekers to make the right connections when seeking a job. The site allows each person to create a profile that can serve at as an online resume and minimal portfolio. You can make your LinkedIn profile stand out by ensuring that the basics of your profile are rock solid, and then going the extra mile to make it exemplary.\n\n## Start with the basics\n\n1. Add a professional profile picture to catch the eye of recruiters. Your profile picture must be professional in order to give a good first impression. If you have use a profile picture that is inappropriate or silly, recruiters will probably remove you from their candidate list immediately. When choosing a profile picture, remember to choose one that:\n\t* Does not include anyone else but you. This reduces confusion regarding who the profile is about and draws all the focus to you. Is just of your head and shoulders. Your profile picture is a small picture and will show your face better if you limit it's scope to just your head and shoulders. Shows you wearing professional business attire. LinkedIn is a professional site. Wearing business attire in your picture is highly recommended. This includes a nice collared shirt and a suit jacket if you wish (for both men and women) or an unrevealing blouse for women. Is in front of a solid background. Solid backgrounds allow the focus to be on you and not what is going on behind you. Has a smile. A smile can make you seem more approachable to those who don't know you. Is preferably taken by someone else. It is OK if it is not done by a professional, but definitely no selfies.\n2. Write an eye-catching headline to draw readers in. Headlines are automatically filled with your most recent job title after you add your experience. These can be boring, and you should consider changing your headline to something more unique. To make yourself stand out, edit your headline to tell the reader who you are and what you are an expert in. For example, \u201cOperations Executive\", \"Performance Driven, Airline Industry Expert\u201d.\n3. Customize your URL to brand yourself. Customizing your URL allows you to reference your LinkedIn page easily in your resume or on business cards and other documents. It should remain simple, with the best kind of URL including just your first and last name with no spaces or special characters. For example, www.linkedin.com\/in\/firstlastname.\n4. Provide an outstanding summary to highlight your talents. Writing a LinkedIn summary is much like writing a professional biography. It should be brief, yet comprehensive enough to give the reader an overview of your career thus far. Also, it should be well-written and engaging to entice them to read through your profile further and accept or request to connect with you. While writing a summary, remember to include the following:\n\t* Tell your story in the first person. This means using the words I, my and mine to make your summary more conversational and easy to read. Explain your expertise and interests. Use examples to show your value to potential clients and future employers. Highlight your key accomplishments. If you have made some great achievements in your career, take the time to list these in your summary. For example, Top Sales Award Winner. State a call to action. Explain what you are looking for while making connections on LinkedIn. For example, \u201copen to new opportunities\u201d, \u201clooking to make mutually beneficial connections\u201d or \u201ccontact me if I can be assistance to you\u201d.\n5. List each job you have held with a summary of tasks to provide detail. As with your resume, list all the jobs you have held. The difference between a LinkedIn profile and a resume is that it is acceptable to add any and all jobs to your experience section, rather than limiting yourself to what is most relevant to the particular job you are applying for, as with a resume. Also, you are also not limited to the 10 year rule as you would be on a resume. Therefore, feel free to list any job you have ever held in your career. Add a brief summary of the purpose of your job and the major tasks you have completed. Bullet key accomplishments. As with a resume, you want to highlight your strengths and accomplishments to show you were successful at your job. For example, \u201cNegotiated a $1.5M sale to increase profit margins by 25%\u201d.\n6. Add all relevant skills to your profile. The skills section of a LinkedIn profile can hold up to 50 skills. It is recommended for you to use all 50 of these slots to provide a full look at what you are capable of. This section is very easy to use because it populates suggestions as you are typing and allows you to click on these for a quick listing. For example, while typing \u201cCoaching\u201d it may also populate \u201cBusiness Coaching, Job Coaching and Staff Coaching\u201d.\n\n\n## Add support material\n\n1. Know your audience to target your profile's contents. Given your career path and the type of people you are trying to attract with your LinkedIn profile, you should know what readers will be looking for and you can give the audience what they want. For example, if you are a writer, your audience will be looking for your creativity and to remain engaged throughout your profile by your choice of words and correct grammar. If, however, you are a sales representative, your audience will be looking for your stats and your ability to sell yourself throughout your profile.\n2. Use concise and effective wording to create impact. Just as in a resume, you must keep your sentences concise (brief) and powerful by using effective wording to get your point across. This means using action words such as: drove, reduced, increased, created, initiated, trained, developed, won, and acquired.\n3. Use keywords to enhance your ranking in search results. Using keywords in your profile is extremely important because these keywords will be used by others who are looking to make connections. The more keywords you add that are related to your experience and field of interest, the higher your profile will rank when searched. For example if a recruiter is looking for someone with \u201csales and lead generation\u201d experience they will add these keywords to the search field. To find the best keywords for you to use, browse job openings for various companies and pick out common words and phrases. If you have experience in these areas, use these keywords in your profile. If you have the experience but do not use the keywords, your profile will not appear in the proper search results.\n4. Add relevant presentations, videos and other files to show your expertise. LinkedIn allows you to get creative with your profile. For each job or education listed, you have the option to upload a document or file to further illustrate your experience. Adding these types of files is great for someone who produces work of a visual nature. For example, professional presentations, photographs, videos, ads and graphics. Be sure to add only files that are relevant to your personal experience and accomplishments, and not something about your company or school. For example, do not add a recruiting video about the company you work for.\n5. Ask for recommendations. Having recommendations in your LinkedIn profile is important, because instead of you telling the reader how great you are, they get a chance to hear it from someone else who has worked with you. Once you have made connections with those who you believe will write you a good recommendation, send them a message by clicking on the \u201cAsk to be recommended\u201d link under your profile edit page.\n6. Use special characters. You can use special characters to make your profile stand out by creating bullet points or breaking up a section and creating lines. However, not all symbols are accepted and translated into LinkedIn.\n","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Planning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to host a sleepover party for a wide range of ages?","response":"If you are throwing a sleepover with guests with ages ranging from seven to twelve (e.g. you are having all your cousins round), it can be tough finding activities to suit everyone. Here are a few games and other activities that will make a wide age ranged sleepover a success.\n\n## Be prepare\n\n1. Before the sleepover you should have a list of \"back up ideas\" for if your sleepover dips. It can happen in the best of sleepovers. One minute, everyone can be having great fun and then the next everyone's arguing or someone starts missing home. For these occasions, you should have a list of back ups that will bring the mood up again. The activities should be fun and not very competitive like hide and seek or just chilling and watching a movie. However if you are going to be playing team games make sure you don't put people who are arguing on the same team.\n2. Get to know your guests. You probably already know a lot about them but if you don't you should find out. It just makes it a lot easier to choose: food, drinks, activities, themes and lots more.\n3. Before the sleepover, you should also decide wether or not to have a theme. Themes can be fun and make your party that tiny bit of extra fun but they can also limit your choices. If you are going to choose a theme then make sure that it suits everyone. For example, if you are doing a princess theme don't have one person not dressed up and left out because they don't really like princesses you either have to rethink the theme or rethink inviting that person. Some theme ideas are:\n\t* princess\n\t* disney\n\t* under the sea\n\t* safari\n\t* a color\n\t* christmas\n\t* Hawaii\n\t* Halloween\n\t* a book you all like\n\t* a TV show or movie you all like\n\t* sporty\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Since it's a sleepover, you should go all out on the sweets and drinks. Sugary stuff is great, but remember to have other options e.g. pizza, crackers or even fruit because sometimes at 3:00am you might not feel like chocolate or other sugary foods. Remember to check if your guests are vegetarian or vegan or have allergies because a trip to the hospital at 2:00am because Molly ate a Snickers when she has nut allergies will definitely put a damper on the night.\n2. For drinks, make sure you have lots of fizzy juice, try and get stuff you might not normally buy because it is a sleepover. For example maybe if you see some blueberry fizzy juice at your local super market. Even if you all hate it, it could still come in handy for penalties in truth of dare. Once again remember to check if your guests have allergies.\n\n\n## When to go to bed\n\n1. At a sleepover the time you go to bed and the time you fall asleep are two very different times. If there are younger kids (6-7 years old) maybe pulling an allnighter isn't the best idea because it will be you who puts up with the temper tantrums the next day.\n2. Everyones different but it probably isn't a good idea to make younger kids go to bed earlier than the older kids because they will be to anxious about thinking about what they are missing to sleep.\n3. A good idea is to watch a movie while in bed then the younger ones might doze off if it's late (some of the older kids might as well) and then the kids who are still awake can talk or play a quiet game.\n\n\n## Game\n\n1. It can be tough finding games that will suit all age groups because what a 7 year old would find fun a 12 year old probably won't, but there are ways of modifying games so that everyone has a good time.\n2. Murder in the Dark is a very good classic sleepover game and its bundles of fun.There are many different ways of playing but this way is my favorite. Before your guests arrive, cut out cards that are all the same size (one for each guest e.g. if there are 5 people coming make 5 cards) write murderer on one and detective on another and suspect on the rest. If there are children coming who can't read\/are not confident readers draw a shape beside each one and for example say - if you have a square on your card you are the murderer. Everyone keeps their card a secret. The lights go out and if you are the murderer you have to tap people and they have to scream and fall over however if you are the detective and you get tapped you have to put the lights on and try and guess you the murderer is. If they guess right they win but if they don't the murderer wins.\n3. Hide and Seek in the dark is another good game.\n4. If you and your guests like making movies then go for it. There are loads of great apps that can help you with that and they are a great way to remember your sleepover.\n5. Make friendship bracelets.\n6. Build a den. Indoor or outdoor dens\/forts are great fun to make and fun to hide out in. They are also great because all kids from 7 to 12 mostly like making dens so its something everyone can join in with.\n7. Pillow fights are also great just make sure the pillows don't have any hard zips or anything on them.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to recognize fundamentalist thinking?","response":"Fundamentalism is a concept that often, historically, had religious connotations. However, it's a common term that describes a way of expressing ideals and related activities to express (from the point of view of the speaker) a perceived, accurate, ideological focus. Here are some common factors among those referred to as fundamentalists.\n\n## Step\n\n1. Understand the definition: Identifying persons who hold a \"strict adherence to the fundamental principles of any set of beliefs\" -- as viewed by another individual. The use of the word \"fundamentalist\" is often intended to denote a certain point of view, but \"fundamentalist\" may be used in a negative connotation, being pejorative (derisive) of particular scientific, political or religious concepts.\n2. Understand that seeking to recognize fundamentalism may be educational and informative. This is not to indicate that fundamentalism is \"on-\/off-beat\", centered versus eccentric (different) or \"good\" versus \"bad\".\n3. Do not equate \"fundamentalism\" with being \"religious\". As, some of the unflattering literature on fundamentalism was written by people who consider themselves quite religious but who have differing doctrines and understandings. Confusing or mixing the two concepts will lead to misconceptions in identifying fundamentalist expression and activity (behavior). Judging the fundamentalist harshly could lead to social stigma, discrimination, prejudice, bias and possibly hatred.\n4. Appreciate the differences among varied types of fundamentalists. The term has been historically used to describe various, diverse groups, religious movements, political movements and philosophical or scientific schools of thought. The term itself has several definitions in use and meaning.\n5. Seek a common set of behaviors and indicators that are dominant\/common in the different uses according to a particular definition.\n\n\n## Indications by usage\n\n1. Use the word responsibly to credit and acknowledge a defined set of concepts, or beliefs or their advocates. Following is a list of some of the different uses of the term throughout history:\n\t* Religious Fundamentalism:\n\t* Fundamentalist Christianity recognizes an adherence to a basic set of Biblical, fundamental principles to preserve unity and harmony among believers. These fundamentals include a literal interpretation of the Bible as the divinely inspired and infallible Word of God and the necessity of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ's atonement. Some consider Christian fundamentalism to be identical with evangelicalism. Jesus said -- \"...go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (Matthew 28:19,20 NIV). While Christian fundamentalists hold unswervingly to their basic tenets, they encourage open-minded study of the Bible, intellectual discussion of \"true\" (Biblical) versus \"false\" (non-Biblical) doctrines and whether some traditional practices are\/are-not Biblical. Islamic Fundamentalism: This includes advocating return to the \"fundamentals\" of Islam: The Quran and The Sunnah. Definitions vary as some insist that Islamic belief requires all Muslims be fundamentalists and is, also, a term used by outsiders to describe perceived trends within Islam; whereas, some figures of Islamic fundamentalism may be termed \"Islamists\". Some say that \"Radical Islam\" is the term for movements beginning in the 1920s -- and that, some say, is not a return to the more historic fundamentals. Jewish Fundamentalism\n\t* Mormon Fundamentalism\n\t* Hindu Fundamentalism\n\t* Atheistic Fundamentalists. - Observe atheistic fundamentalism as whether there is a strong disdain toward those who espouse religion, and some would say, a dogmatic opposition to what appears to be religious tradition. Some atheist thinkers, such as Richard Dawkins, argue that no such fundamentalism exists, and that the term is meant to be disparaging of atheists' concepts. Non-religious Fundamentalism:\n\t* Political Conservatism (Fundamentalism) including being \"strict constructionist\", being a \"constitutional originalist\" to follow the traditional meaning of the constitution and the basic law, not some modern, re-formed meaning. Scientism (Fundamentalism). - Consider that beginning in the nineteenth century, some scientists stated scientism as the view that all aspects of the universe are knowable through the methods of the scientist and that advances in all forms of knowledge could be made through scientific progress; whereas, philosophy had historically relied on intuition and other modes of thought as the source of knowledge and as equal or preferred to empirical investigation.\n\t* \n\t* Market Fundamentalism. - check to verify whether there is a strong belief in laissez-faire, free-market systems of financial regulation. The recession was not due to regulation, but to schemes including an over-trusted kind of certificate called the \"Collateralized debt obligation\"; this is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS) whose value and payments are supposed to be derived from a portfolio of fixed-income underlying assets (but many were like bad mutual-fund shares). CDOs securities are split into different risk classes, but many bad \"CDOs\" were over-rated conglomerations of some good preferred stocks, bonds and too much of over-valued bad mortgages as some trillions of dollars of poor \"investments\" sold around the world -- and the related, bad-mortgages were a major cause of the banking crisis, also devastating to the economy. Some left-economists declared that the global financial crisis, so caused, of 2008 destroyed market fundamentalist's ideas of free markets. This expression, \"market fundamentalism,\" was promulgated by George Soros in his 1998 book, The Crisis of Global Capitalism. As is \"atheistic fundamentalism\", \"market fundamentalism\" is often used as a pejorative to designate perceived, ideological dogma with which one may disagree.\n2. Be as objective as possible realizing indicators depend upon ones point of view -- or, perhaps, bias. Do not go looking for \"signs\" in persons to prove they are indeed fundamentalists after you question their being so. Instead, only use this as a reference. In other words -- if, by chance, unintentionally, you encounter some of the indicators in a person's expressed views, look for the other indications very closely, trying to prove that they are not there! If you fail to eliminate them, you can relatively well identify the person as fundamentalist.\n3. Be sure that the indicators listed under \"Common Indications\" apply before going any further.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"How to invite people to a party?","response":"Planning, hosting, and enjoying a good party is a great way to build and strengthen friendships and community!  An important, but sometimes undervalued element in the success of a party is the invitation.  The following answer will have you writing and sending out excellent invitations - and welcoming in happy guests - in no time!\n\n## General approaches to invitations\n\n1. Design your invitation to resemble the party theme. For example, a disco-themed party invitation could feature a large disco ball. People are likely to look at your invitation and make a quick first impression -- you want that first impression to be informative and fun. If your party doesn't have a theme, have the invitation mirror the formality of the party. If you're throwing a black tie soiree, keep it simple with a plain border, a fancy font, and to-the-point text. If you're throwing a rave, make your invitation as wild as you'd like. You can also send a mail to your friends and relatives to give an invitation for a party.\n2. Include all important information guests will need to know. That's usually the time and date of the party, location, where to call for more information, and whether or not the guest needs to RSVP are all important. And do they need to bring anything (food, swimsuit, etc.)? Does the party have a specific time it ends? You may want to include a few selling points if applicable. Will you be having awards for best dressed? Provide beer and wine? Will there be 50 varieties of European cheeses? Give your guests a slight clue as to what you have planned for the evening to whet their appetite.\n3. Respect the level of formality of your party. A formal party should require a more formal invitation, such as a letter. An informal party invitation is up to your discretion \u2013 a phone call, email, or social media event would all work fine. Formal events generally require a bit of advanced notice -- preferably around 2 weeks.\n4. Decide how many people total you want at your party. There are several things to consider when thinking about a party's size and attendance:\n\t* How big is the space where your party will be? Can your apartment hold 10 people, 50 people, 200 people? Is it okay for the people you invite to bring friends? How many friends? Do you have a say over who those friends are? How many people can you feed and have drinks for at your party? Does this include friends of friends? If you're having your party at a club, bar, hotel, rented room, etc., does the owner have limits on the number of people that can be there?\n\n\n## Sending mailed invitations\n\n1. Make sure to send out written invitations at least two or three weeks before the event. \"Snail mail\" can take a while to be processed, delivered, read, and replied to. A time before that and people may write it off thinking, \"I don't know what I'm doing for breakfast, much less next month!\" Too soon and people already have plans. Around 2 weeks out is your best bet.\n2. Make sure you have the current and correct addresses of your guests. An outdated or misspelled address could leave one of your best friends out of your party! If you're not sure of someone's address, contact them and confirm it.\n3. Decorate your card appropriately. A mailed invitation is a great opportunity to impress a guest, but don't over-complicate an invitation to a simple party - this may intimidate guests. You're just inviting them for a good time! Have something on the envelope that clearly indicates your invitation is something to be intrigued by. Yours isn't just another piece of junk mail!\n\n\n## Inviting guests over the phone\n\n1. If you don\u2019t have them, obtain the phone numbers of those you wish to invite. No need to be sneaky about it -- just send them a quick message online. If you don't have their online info, ask a friend who likely has their information.\n2. Call your guests at a time when they are unlikely to have other engagements. They'll be less excited about your party if you're calling them when they're in the middle of a meeting or in between bites of food. Before or after dinner is usually a safe bet. People are generally less busy between 5 and 6pm, or after 7pm. Gauge what time they eat dinner (different cultures, different times) and work around that. Earlier in the week is best, too. Don't call too late! Call before 9:30 or 10:00pm. You don't want to wake anyone up with what should be a warm and welcome invitation.\n3. Make use of the personal nature of a phone call. Chat with your guests as you fill them in on the details of your party. Your winning personality will sell the party for you! Try starting out with the usual pleasantries. \"How are you? \", \"How is work going? \", and \"How's the family?\" are often good starting points. Choose a natural pause in conversation or termination of a subject to bring up that you are having a party. After you have alerted them to the party, you can answer any immediate questions the guest might have, and even gauge interest through tone of voice.\n4. Make sure your guest remembers the important party information. The spoken word can be easily forgotten, and it may be worth emailing, texting, or mailing them some of the details. They could be swamped with a dozen other things going on, even if they are really interested in your party. Make sure they know what's expected of them. Sometimes getting involved (like bringing a dish) can get them remembering and even looking forward to it.\n5. If your guest cannot give an immediate yes or no, set up a time to call them back. You're not nagging them; you're simply getting a head count so you can plan your party accordingly. If they can't give you a yes or no on the second go-round, it's best to discount them. If they show up, fine, but if they don't, it's no skin of your nose. The party will still go on and it'll be great.\n\n\n## Inviting guests in person\n\n1. Approach your guests at a convenient time. Invite them during a time you might see them anyway. Maybe you share a scheduled activity together? Otherwise, schedule an activity or meet up with them as is convenient. The more time they have, the more receptive they'll be to your approach.\n2. Leave guests a way out. Don't invite guests in a way that makes them feel they have to say yes. Your party should be fun and totally accommodating. If they can't make it, they should feel a little disappointed -- not guilty! For example, instead of saying \"You're coming to my party next weekend, right? \", say something like \"Hey \\*guest's name\\*, I'm having a party next weekend. I'd love it if you could come!\"\n3. Make sure to give them all the necessary information. Much like with a phone invitation, it is easy to forget details in the heat of a personal conversation\/invitation. Make sure to cover where and when it is, what the occasion is, and if they need to bring anything. To avoid guests forgetting information, you can hand out a physical invitation as well. This doesn't have to be a tried-and-true invite so much as a reminder. Short of that, you can offer to write information down or text it to their phone, etc.\n4. Chat up your guests. You can raise interest for your party with an in-person invitation. This can be especially effective in a group setting. The more excited you are about it and the more you can build it up with detail, the less they'll be likely to forget and the more likely they are to feed off your excitement and get excited, too. Describe what your party will be like, and how excited you are. You can say something like \"I'm really looking forward to it; it's going to be great!\" You can also use tone and body language in a personal conversation for added effect. If you don\u2019t have the party\u2019s details nailed down, open them up for suggestions by your guests. Guests are much more likely to come if they had a hand in the creation of your party.\n5. Be aware that you may offend people you didn\u2019t invite who overhear your invitations to others. Be discreet when you're doling out your in-person invitations. Make sure only the people you want invited are hearing the discussion. If it's an issue, tell them that you can only have so many people at the party. Because of that, you need them to keep word on the down-low. They'll feel special for making the VIP list!\n\n\n## Sending email invitations\n\n1. Create an E-card. There are multiple online services with which you can create fun and engaging E-cards. This is an entertaining and often free way to invite guests to a party. And it gets the buzz going! E-Cards are sent to email addresses just like a normal message, but they include images, sound, and sometimes short animations. E-cards can also be acceptable for semi-formal parties if themed correctly. If you prefer to send a normal email, just include the necessary information, any additional message, and an image if desired. For more information, check out How to Write an Email to a Friend\n2. Go to a website that offers free email invitations. Evite, Socializr, and MyPunchBowl are three popular choices. Choose a style that fits the theme and\/or mood of your party, and be sure to include everything that needs including! There are a dozens of invitation websites out there. If the one your one isn't doing it for you, just go to another one!\n3. Enter in basic required information, such as location, date, time, etc. Type a nice, handcrafted message if desired. Make it unique and personal -- not just some template that will do. The more time you spend on it, the more impressive it'll be. Also consider adding end time, costume specifics, meal details, etc. Anything you think may give your guests a better picture of what the plan is can be useful.\n4. Type the email addresses of the people you\u2019d like to invite. It is usually necessary to include a comma between each email address, just for the record. Some websites will let you know when the messages have been read and will keep correspondence for you -- take advantage of it and select this before sending!\n5. Preview the invitation and send it through the website. It'll keep tabs on your recipients and will handle the RSVPs. Though you may need to send a courtesy text to a few of your busier friends! Sometimes emails do get lost in the shuffle.\n\n\n## Sending social media invitations\n\n1. Choose a social media platform that most of your friends and acquaintances use. Use the infrastructure of the social media site to create an event, and send invitations to all those you\u2019d like to see at your party. For more information on how to create such events, check out How to Create an Event on Facebook\n2. Include all the necessary information. Throw in a picture of two if you like. The more complete it is, the more people can get a picture of the awesomeness of your party. Be creative here! Saying, \"Hey guys, having a party at 7 on Friday!\" won't get them jazzed.\n3. If you can, start up a conversation in the event panel. Be sure to respond to the comments and questions of others. This way you can start being a good host before your party even begins. Getting people involved in the makings of your party will ensure their attendance and get them feeling like a part of the magic.\n4. Be wary of how many people you invite. Often times, the amount of people you invite to a social media event and the amount of people that show up are quite different. Never take the numbers you see online at face value. Usually, fewer people show up than RSVP \"yes,\" but the discrepancy can trend in either direction. Especially if it's open and people bring friends. Generally, the higher the number of people that RSVP \"yes,\" the more likely it is for your party to \"snowball\" into a much bigger event than you planned for.\n","primary_tag":"Planning","other_tags":"Advice seeking,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How to wax your armpits?","response":"Waxing your armpits may be more painful than shaving, but it keeps your armpits hairless for 4-6 weeks. You can reduce the pain and prevent ingrown hairs from occurring by preparing your armpits and using the right kind of wax.\n\n## Get ready to wax\n\n1. Prepare your underarms. You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:\n\t* Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin. If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove. Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than \u20444 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's \u20444 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.\n2. Wrap yourself up in an old towel. The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting impregnated with wax.\n3. Powder your underarms. Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.\n4. Heat up body wax. Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny. If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot. Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores. You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1\/4 cup water and 1\/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.\n\n\n## Apply the wax\n\n1. Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit. Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax. Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time. Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair strands will get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.\n2. Apply a wax strip. Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place. If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip. Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off. If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.\n3. Remove the strip. Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit. If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip. If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.\n\n\n## Finish the job\n\n1. Examine your armpits in the mirror. If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.\n2. Remove excess wax with oil. Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.\n3. Clean the area. Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging. If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided. Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.\n","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"Waxing your

He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \"Conrack\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world.\nConroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \"what death would sound like.\"  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \"the river\". As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.

{"instruction":"Summarize the following article with one line: \nWhen journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get.\n\nFor nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. \n\n'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online.  \n\nBaby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry \n\nShady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months\n\nBut the heartbreak did not end there.\n\nAs Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the 'embryo outsourcing' agencies featured in the Vice documentary.\n\nDuring her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies.\n\nAnd if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. \n\nFor the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact 'extra' babies being sold on the black market.\n\nThe agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant.\n\nShocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them\n\nNo morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner \n\nGianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner.\n\n'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. \n\nGianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody.\n\n'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer.\n\nThe sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team.\n\nIn the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money.\n\nCommercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World.\n\n'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element.\n\nNo options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money \n\nDormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth\n\nTight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room \n\nAnd while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a 'cheap' alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family.  \n\nWomen can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives.\n\nBut there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised.\n\nWhen I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second\n\nSurrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day.\n\nGianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section.\n\nDr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession.\n\nAnd while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options.   \n\nDuring the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' \n\nDishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area \n\nNo choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day \n\nToo quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country \n\nShe continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.'\n\nAnother surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'.\n\nGianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation.\n\n'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said.\n\nGianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate.\n\nHe made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival.\n\n'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted.\n\nAs a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority' have no idea this dark underbelly exits.\n\nGianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","response":"Here is the summary: \nVice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series. In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000.

Efforts to control future SARS outbreaks depend on the accurate and early identification of SARS-CoV infected patients. A real-time fluorogenic RT-PCR assay based on the 3 -noncoding region (3 -NCR) of SARS-CoV genome was developed as a quantitative SARS diagnostic tool. The ideal amplification efficiency of a sensitive SARS-CoV RT-PCR assay should yield an E value (PCR product concentration increase per amplification cycle) equal to 2.0. It was demonstrated that the 3 -NCR SARS-CoV based RT-PCR reactions could be formulated to reach excellent E values of 1.81, or 91% amplification efficacy. The SARS-CoV cDNA preparations derived from viral RNA extract and the cloned recombinant plasmid both exhibit the identical amplification characteristics, i.e. amplification efficacy using the same PCR formulation developed in this study. The viral genomic copy (or genomic equivalences, GE) per infectious unit (GE\/pfu) of SARS-CoV used in this study was also established to be approximate 1200-1600:1. The assay's detection sensitivity could reach 0.005 pfu or 6-8 GE per assay. It was preliminarily demonstrated that the assay could efficiently detect SARS-CoV from clinical specimens of SARS probable and suspected patients identified in Taiwan. The 3 -NCR based SARS-CoV assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity testing samples of patients with acute respiratory disease from a non-SARS epidemic region.","response":"Here is a title for this paragraph:\nDevelopment and evaluation of an efficient 3-noncoding region-based SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RT-PCR assay for detection of SARS-CoV.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Generate a title for the following paragraph:\n\nCoxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies. Citation Wang Y, Pfeiffer JK. 2016.

My parents, upon learning that we were a thing, said, \"remember, you are her ticket to stay in America.\" Her parents, upon learning that we were a real thing, wanted to know how much money I make (I'm a grad student), and wanted to make sure I was OK with their tradition of supporting parents in their retirement as a sign of respect (despite that they are well off enough to not need such help).

{"instruction":"Give me a one-line summary of the article: \nChange is coming to Ferguson. In the next few weeks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department, which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the DOJ review of the Ferguson Police Department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups. Now, after a half year of unrest, and with citizens on Tuesday electing two new black city council members, change is beginning to come to Ferguson. The question is, what kind of change?\n\nThe report from the Department of Justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens. Through illegal traffic stops and arrests, and the use of excessive force, the police department held town residents in bondage. The municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time.\n\nCourt costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town. Rather than a force for public safety, the Ferguson Police Department became, according to Attorney General Eric Holder, \"a collection agency\" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town's African-American residents.\n\nThe evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating. It included blatantly racist emails traded among officers, and evidence that African-Americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department. But just a few weeks before the release of the report, the Ferguson police chief declared there were \"no racial issues\" in his department.\n\nFerguson's ugly, racist emails released\n\nThe recommendations in the report, ranging from new training and supervision of police officers, addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system, will, if implemented, remake the law enforcement system in the town. (A grand jury that investigated the shooting of Brown by Officer Darren Wilson chose not to file charges against him and the Justice Department also didn't find reason to prosecute.)\n\nWithout question, change is coming to the town's government. Town Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's most powerful official and, until the DOJ's blistering report, the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny, resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city's deputy manager. Three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and, on Tuesday, citizens elected two black candidates to the city council, changing its racial composition: Five of six members and the mayor were white. Now the council will be 50% black.\n\nFerguson's hapless police Chief Thomas Jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence. The department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests.  The appointment of a commander from the State Highway Patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest.\n\nJackson's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command. And so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council, there will be a new police chief in Ferguson.\n\nBut does that mean that fundamental change will come to Ferguson? Not necessarily. Not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks. The Department of Justice's full-on negotiations with the leadership in Ferguson will determine the shape of the new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nIndeed, the DOJ report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with St. Louis County. Many local activists have suggested just such a solution, but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in Ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the DOJ can fold St. Louis County Police into its monitoring and reform process.\n\nEqually important were the April 7 general elections. Turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in Ferguson, with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than African-Americans. But local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns..\n\nThe Mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign (although a petition for his recall has been circulating). That means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the DOJ to remake the police department. Has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks? Community activists and residents must ensure that Mayor James Knowles plans to represent their vision of new Ferguson Police Department.\n\nBut there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in Ferguson and throughout St. Louis County. Ferguson's governing structure, with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor, mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the United States.\n\nThat form of governance might have been precisely what thriving, middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like St. Louis. But working class suburbs like Ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents, may need a more robust form of governance.\n\nIn any case, a system in which the elected officials have minimal power, but non-elected leaders, like the town manager and the chief of police, have inordinate power, is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable, non-representative government that controlled Ferguson's residents. Yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country.\n\nLikewise, Missouri, like the vast majority of states, holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years, guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in March and April as Missouri law requires Ferguson to do.\n\nIt's not that Ferguson is so different than towns across America. It's precisely because Ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high.\n\nFerguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in St. Louis County plagued by similar governance flaws, including those towns led by African-Americans. And Ferguson's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country, where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population.\n\nChange is coming to Ferguson. But the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents, whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical American town.","response":"Here is the summary: \nTimothy robenhorst found out his son had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him..

Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}

People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.'\n\nMr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law.\n\nBut the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run\n\nMr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so.\n\nMr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum.\n\nThe European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches.\n\nThe Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to \u00a365,000 in costs.\n\nThe league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season.\n\nHe said he does not know whether he can retrieve the \u00a31,000 fine and \u00a31,500 costs ordered by the magistrates.\n\nDespite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games.\n\nSince the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling.\n\nIn 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches.\n\nMs Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for \u00a3800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at \u00a3700-a-month.\n\nThe Premier League took legal action against her Mrs Murphy and she was fined \u00a38,000 for dishonest reception of a television reception in 2006.\n\nBut a European Court of Justice ruling said having an exclusive system of TV rights was contrary to EU law and the High Court overturned her conviction.\n\nA recent investigation by trade publication, The Morning Advertiser, quoted a pub landlord saying Sky Sports cost him \u00a316,000-a-year, compared to the \u00a3300-per-year of screening it illegally.\n\nThe decision came after Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy won a European court battle over her conviction.

It stretches its horrible limbs as it awakes from sleep. Not yet fully functional, it stumbles to an energy station. A gruesome black liquid powers the Human, along with a form of solid sustenance. The Human uses so much energy that it must refuel at least three times a day.\nNext, the Human enters a grooming station. It sharpens and shines its most fearsome weapon: its hideous fangs. Humans are often seen baring their teeth at enemies and allies alike to assert dominance. The Human will also don a carefully chosen set of armor. Some sets are meant to beguile, others are meant to intimidate, still others are meant to appear non-threatening. The Humans are truly masters of manipulation.\nWe cannot trust these Humans. Their entire society is built around deception and violence. If we are to be free in this galaxy, we must be rid of this dangerous race.","primary_tag":"Role playing","other_tags":"Creative writing,Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

There is Momma Mouse and Papa Mouse and their three children, Esther Mouse, Rosie Mouse, and Rachel Mouse. Every morning they walk to the edge of the woods. There is a field of wheat and they climb the stalks that are taller then skyscrapers. They fill their bags with wheat. Every night they make bread and tell stories under the stars. They were very happy.\nOne day there was a visitor. It was a new creature with big teeth and a tail like a paddle. What could it be? This was Mr Beaver. He and Mrs Beaver had moved to the river nearby. They wanted to build a bridge. The mice were very excited. A bridge would be a fine thing indeed. That night Papa Mouse and Mr Beaver planned the bridge while Mrs Beaver taught the little mice how to swim. There was no lake to pratice in so the mice filled the washtub and carefully floated.\nSoon the building of the bridge started. It was going very well. In the early evenings the mice would use their bags to carry mud to make mice-sized bricks. Then one day they noticed that the bricks were melting! When the mud got too wet it just fell out of the bridge. What could be done?\nThe mice thought and thought. They added stones but it was too rough. They added grass but it was too slippery. Then one day Esther Mouse added some wheat leaves. They were dry and just right.\nThe bridge was quickly built and the mice visited their friends every day.\nThe End\n(P.S.

In a world like ours, where everyone was equal, everything was so... similar.\nIn fact, I worked hard every day. Why shouldn't I have more than others?\nThe more I thought about it, the more beautiful the idea seemed. I could taste it, that feeling of pride when I saw how little others had.

This is true, to an extent- they have big bulky machines designed to protect them in vacuum and their bodies are essentially useless.\nHowever, further investigation reveals 2 things.\n1. By some cruel coincidence of nature, the human species evolved through a barbaric process known as 'survival of the fittest.' This means that any humans who were not optimized for their environment would die, so that only the best would pass on their genes.\n2.

{"instruction":"It's the year 2114. You're a history student. Your assignment? To write an essay comparing the events of 2014 with what happened 100 years earlier.","response":"As a history student in the year 2114, I have been tasked with comparing the events of the year 2014 to what happened exactly 100 years prior, in the year 1914. Although these two years were separated by a century, they share some striking similarities and differences that have shaped the course of history in very different ways.\n\nOne of the most significant events of 2014 was the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, which quickly became an international health crisis. Similarly, in 1914, the world was facing a health crisis with the outbreak of the First World War, which affected millions of people worldwide. Both crises brought about significant changes in the way governments and societies responded to public health and international relations, highlighting the importance of cooperation and solidarity in times of crisis.\n\nAnother similarity between 1914 and 2014 was the rise of new technologies that transformed the way people lived and worked. In 1914, the world was experiencing the dawn of the industrial age, with new machines and technologies making their way into factories and homes. Similarly, in 2014, the world was experiencing the rise of the digital age, with new technologies like smartphones and social media transforming the way people communicated and connected with one another.\n\nHowever, there were also many differences between 1914 and 2014. One of the most significant differences was the level of globalization and interdependence between countries in 2014. By this time, the world was much more interconnected than it was a century earlier, with goods, services, and people moving across borders more freely than ever before. In contrast, in 1914, the world was more divided, with nations operating largely independently of one another.\n\nAnother major difference between 1914 and 2014 was the political landscape of the world. In 1914, Europe was dominated by a complex web of alliances and rivalries that would ultimately lead to the outbreak of World War I. In contrast, the world of 2014 was marked by greater cooperation and diplomacy between nations, with the United Nations and other international organizations playing a key role in promoting peace and stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while there were some similarities between 1914 and 2014, the world had undergone significant changes over the course of a century. The rise of new technologies, the growth of globalization, and the development of international institutions had all transformed the way people lived and interacted with one another. As a history student in 2114, I can only wonder what changes the world will have undergone by the next century and how they will shape the course of history.","primary_tag":"Role playing","other_tags":"Creative writing,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Re-write mythology.","response":"Long before the days of the War of the Gods, Titans reigned over the face of the Earth.  As with any rulers, there were some who ruled fairly and others who did not. Among the more benevolent leaders was Hyperion, the Lord of Light. He was called upon for wisdom and discernment; mortals valued his insight and praised his control of the heavenly bodies.\nYet Hyperion had one great love: Theia, his consort. She was a Titaness of radiance, a mother goddess who shone like the sun on all who sought after her. The two Titans were very much in love, and their love gave vibrancy to the life around them. They were happy - for a time.\nThat time ended when the Gods declared war on the Titans, with Zeus at the forefront of battle. Cronus, Hyperion's brother and Lord over all the Titans, called Hyperion into battle against the upstart Gods. Knowing the war would end in defeat, Hyperion left anyway, answering the call of his brother and king.\nBut before he left, Hyperion gave Theia a gift: a ring of radiant light to wear around her finger. He told her that the ring would tell her if he was safe; that the ring would glow with a silver light when he was in danger. Theia took it gratefully and bid her lover farewell. It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion. Gaia listened, and so the ring grew.\nNow the ring encircles the Earth, a strip of radiance that gives off silver moonlight every evening. Mankind looks up to the ring and is reminded of Theia's anguish, as well as her love for her fallen lover.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Write about a world where whenever somebody writes on their skin, it appears on their soulmate's body as well.","response":"It took a damn long time for my ink to show. As kids, none of us could really make out any writing that showed up on our bodies. But then, most everyone's was at least somewhat legible by the time they were a teen, and almost always completely clear by the time they were 18 or 19. Throughout high school and college I watched my friends use their writing to find their soulmates as soon as they could make out the messages their alleged soulmates were sending. By the time I could read mine though, I was already in my mid twenties, and over the excitement of it all. The messages that would appear on my arms and hands were usually questions about me, doodles, or suggestions to meet up. I ignored them all, and went on with my life.\nAfter a year or so, I met Roy. He hated the idea of finding a soulmate though the strange and foreign messages on his body just as much as I did, so we stuck together in our rebelliousness. Weeks went by, and the messages we got from our \"soulmates\" came less and less. They faded, as the months Roy and I spent together went on. Eventually, they stopped altogether. Not once, in all those years we spent together did we ever wonder what happened to the ones who sent the messages. All we needed was each other. Today though, as we send out our wedding invitations, Roy is staring at me, with happy tears in his eyes. His hand is held towards me, with a simple phone number written down in the middle of his palm. The same number, in the same marker, in the same handwriting that I just wrote down on my own palm.\nI was never told to love Roy. It wasn't fate that brought us together. We did that on our own. We trusted our love, and in doing so, became soulmates.","primary_tag":"Creative writing","other_tags":"Brainstorming","claim_uncertainty":null}

At some point the students know perfectly how to use these two functions but they don't know about <code>stdin<\/code>, <code>stdout<\/code> and <code>argv<\/code>. \nTo me and according to many programming principles (e.g. KISS) a program should not interrupt the execution for prompting the user. Instead, and this is a much clever approach, the developer should learn to use the power of pipes and use the options and the arguments. \nI think this:\n<code>$ whatdaywas 1982 02 16\nMonday\n<\/code>\nIs much better than: \n<code>$ whatdaywas\nEnter a year: 1982\nEnter a month: 2\nEnter a day: 16\nIt was a Monday.\n<\/code>\nIs there any rationale behind this pedagogical approach?","response":"When tutoring young CS students, user input is actually a tricky concept. If it were not for user input, the results of any program could be pre-compiled into nothing but its output. You get one lesson from getting all the input right at the beginning, with argc\/argv, but from that point on, its just the computer churning. You get a different lesson from getting input during the execution of the program.\n\nThe idea of getting input from the user is surprisingly non-intuitive, given that nearly every program we interact with on a daily basis does it. This suggests that introducing it early helps prune misconceptions about how computers work before they become a real problem.\n\nObviously not every student is the same, but a particular pattern is that they can understand what a program should do when it executes but not how that actually happens. They can look at\n<code>BOOL x = TRUE;\nif (x)\n    printf(\"Hello\\n\");\nelse\n    printf(\"World\\n\");\n<\/code>\nAnd they can intuit that the program should print \"Hello\", but they can't intuit how a computer can possibly do so. Students are often told to figure the compiler does the \"magic,\" and figure out which printf to use (let's ignore optimizers for a moment).\nHowever, when the values come from input, you can no longer think about the computer as a magic device which reaches the final result immediately. You have to see that it is following steps. We know this, but it seems many students don't grasp this at first.\nIf you have inputs coming from `argv`, its easier to keep this illusion going. If you have input during the program, after the program has already done something, you have to realize what's going on quicker.  In particular, it gets you closer to the point of realizing that the input the computer asks for may vary based on previous inputs (press 1 to calculate the area of a circle, press 2 to calculate the area of a rectangle.  Depending on the next scanf\/gets, the computer will ask for one additional number or two).","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Even for someone who has a family, friends and coworkers that aren't Buddhists?","response":"Whether you have to follow a monastic lifestyle to attain enlightenment depends. At first approximation, the answer is: yes in Theravada, no in Mahayana. Since probably as early as Milindapanha (~100 BCE) and most certainly by the time of Visuddhimagga (~430CE), the orthodox (~Theravada) position was, you must be a monk to attain Nirvana.\n\nRegarding Enlightenment, I should point out that Enlightenment is the goal of Mahayana, while in Theravada, the final goal is usually called Nirvana (Nibbana in Pali), not Enlightenment (Bodhi in Pali). In Mahayana, Enlightenment can be attained by a layperson.\n\nThese are \"official\" positions (as much as we can talk about official positions in such a heterogeneous conglomerate of teachings as Buddhism). Informally, what some Mahayana schools call \"Enlightenment\" is what Theravada schools call mere \"stream-entry\". Other Mahayana schools however have this notion of multiple levels (bhumi), in which what Theravada calls \"stream-entry\" is level 1 of 10, with Final Enlightenment counted as 11th. It gets complicated from \"stream-entry\" onward, because the boundaries of \"self\" no longer apply, thus it is difficult to talk about Enlightenment with no subject to tie it to.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is extremely difficult to make any meaningful progress towards Enlightenment\/Nirvana if most of the focus is on pursuing material ends (success, wealth, entertainment, helping your relatives achieve the same, etc). In order to get pretty close to X while leading a semi-normal life, one's top priority must be spiritual practice, followed by family and everything else. This basically means, squeezing study of Buddhist philosophy here and there, making meditation part of your daily routine, and, most importantly, deliberately utilizing your family & work situations as a shooting range for Dharma practice.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

Schedule a meeting in advance. Don't try to have the conversation with your boss when either of you are is not in an ideal state for effective communication. For example, please avoid the discussion while driving to work or on a busy Friday. Schedule an appointment to meet so neither of you will be rushed or distracted.\n\n2. Focus on the positive aspects and avoid starting the conversation with apologies. Instead, let your boss know you're happy about your pregnancy and committed to fulfilling your responsibilities both at work and in your growing family.\n\n3. Be flexible (but not spineless). Develop a well-thought-out plan but remain open to discussion and compromise. Come up with a realistic bottom line and stick to it.\n\n4. Document the agreed-upon details of your pregnancy protocol and maternity leave in written form to eliminate any potential confusion or misunderstandings in the future.\n\n5. Never underestimate the power of parents. If your company isn't as family-friendly as you'd like, consider joining forces with coworkers to petition for better parental perks. Making sure that similar allowances are made for employees who must take time off to care for sick spouses or parents may help unite you with coworkers who don\u2019t have children.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":null}

I imagine that in math research, one has more control\/ownership of their work, there's no lab to be a part of and contribute to, one's funding is typically in the form of teaching stipends, and the meetings are typically one-on-one, with no group meetings to attend.\nIs a math PhD a better experience than a science PhD, in the sense that there is significantly less risk of working for a problematic, unethical, malicious scientist\/professor who only cares about himself\/herself?","response":"First, please keep in mind that the number of questions on the public forum doesn't give any indication of how common such issues are, since people usually only post when something is wrong. We don't hear about all the cases where everything is fine. It is unclear why math advisors should inherently be better people than in any other field, and there is no empirical evidence that warrants this. However, a few of the specific issues you mention are perhaps less likely to arise in mathematics, due to cultural and structural reasons.\n\n>\"my advisor has stopped funding me\"\n\nIn the US, at least, the main avenue of funding for math graduate students is through teaching assistantships, since math departments teach a large number of service courses. Faculty who have grants can sometimes offer their students a research assistantship instead, so that the student doesn't have to teach. But a student really isn't completely reliant on their advisor for funding. Moreover, there typically aren't major expenses for the research itself (no expensive equipment, etc), so as long as the student is getting paid, research can continue.\n(This is not necessarily the case in other countries.)\n\n>\"my advisor wants to be 1st author, when I did the majority of the work!\"\n\nThe general practice in mathematics is that all authors are listed alphabetically, and the concept of \"first authorship\" does not exist. As such, people don't bother to keep track of who did the \"majority\" of the work. Thus this particular issue doesn't arise in mathematics.\n\n>\"my advisor is stealing my ideas!\"\n\nWhile individual departments may vary, I think there's a general sense in mathematics that a joint paper \"counts\" about the same as a solo paper. As such, if a student has contributed to a project, the advisor has no particular incentive not to include them as an author on the paper.\n\n>\"my advisor wants to add another student to the paper and this is unfair!\"\n\nAs above, it isn't any particular disadvantageous to a student if another student is added.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking,Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

{"instruction":"Would a bullet made from ice be capable of killing somebody at 100 metres before melting?","response":"The short answer is probably no.\nIt would either shatter because of the amount of force the weapon puts on it or melt because of the heat (in case of a regular combustion gun). The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"What is the difference between a mode and a scale?","response":"A **scale** is a sequence of ascending or descending unit pitches that form a palette of notes that can be used to form a melody. Most scales in Western music conform to a particular key; that is, a sequence of notes that will be sharp or flat by default. Not all scales have keys; the chromatic scale is a scale of all possible semitone steps used in Western music, while the whole-tone scale is a scale composed of intervals two semitones apart.\nWithin a particular key, there are 7 notes in a single octave, before reaching the 8th note which is named the same as the first note and is at double the frequency. The seven notes have differing intervals between adjacent notes; sometimes it's one half-step (semitone), while other times it's a whole step (two semitones). The pattern of whole-step\/half-step intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting from the note for while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, each of those seven notes could be used as the base note of an ascending sequence. Each such sequence, created by starting on a different note in the key, is a **mode** of that key, and each mode has a name:\n\n* Ionian - starts on the tonic; the note for which the key is named. In the key of C, the Ionian mode starts on C. This mode is the most common, and colloquially called the **major scale**. The pattern is WWHWWWH.\n* Dorian - starts on the next note higher in the key than the tonic (D, in the key of C). WHWWWHW.\n* Phrygian - starts on the note one major third higher than the tonic (E). HWWWHWW.\n* Lydian - starts on the note one perfect fourth higher than the tonic (F). WWWHWWH.\n* Mixolydian - starts on the note one perfect fifth higher than the tonic (G).

{"instruction":"I want to learn watercolor painting, would you recommend hand painting or digital board painting?","response":"Both traditional watercolor painting and digital watercolor painting exhibit distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTraditional watercolor painting possesses a tactile essence and an organic aura, which captivate numerous artists. Engaging in this art form involves employing tangible materials such as paper, paint, and brushes, inducing a sense of relaxation and therapeutic solace. Moreover, it offers an outcome characterized by spontaneity and unpredictability, thus fostering excitement and a sense of unparalleled uniqueness.\n\nConversely, digital watercolor painting offers an array of merits. It permits the ability to undo or redo actions, grants greater control over paint application, color blending, and facilitates the utilization of multiple layers for artistic endeavors. Furthermore, digital artwork can be effortlessly edited, adjusted, transformed, scaled, and shared, making it particularly advantageous for digital artists and illustrators.\n\nI would suggest exploring both traditional and digital methods if feasible, as this will enable you to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what resonates most harmoniously with you.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How much does it cost to make a MOOC universally accessible, as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990?","response":"The cost of making a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) universally accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of content the MOOC contains ( video \/ text \/ etc.). Meeting the Section 508* requirements for Web pages used in such a course is effectively without cost if one starts out to make such pages accessible. Retrofitting might cost as much as the original project, but the cost should be near zero for modern MOOCs.\n\n* Captioning and Transcripts: Closed (or open) captions are very expensive. Unless done at a foreign sweatshop, cost is $5.00 to $15.00 per minute, so something like $12,000 as a minimum, up over $35,000, for a one-semester course. In other words, the captioning can cost more than the professor. That's at least part of why some institutions employ ASL interpreters for class sections with deaf students. The $5-15 number given above could be reduced by using student labor, especially if the students are majors in the material being subtitled. In addition, captioning through voice recognition is getting much better, but still requires certain amount of manual editing. \n\n* Audio Descriptions: Making course materials available to the blind means being sure that everything that is shown is also described, either by the speaker who is presenting or in a manner that can be rendered through text-to-speech. The latter means being sure that there are good \"alt\" descriptions of images and that appropriate markup, e.g. MathML, is used for things like equations. In disciplines like computing, that isn't onerous, and the costs may disappear in the weeds of getting the course done. Things might be very different in a discipline like the visual arts.\n\n* Screen Reader Compatibility: Ensuring that the MOOC is compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies can involve additional development and testing efforts. This cost may vary depending on the complexity of the course platform and its current level of accessibility.\n\nIt is recommended to consult with accessibility experts, organizations specializing in accessible design, or accessibility consultants who can provide more accurate estimates based on the specific requirements of your MOOC. They can conduct a comprehensive evaluation and provide cost estimates tailored to your project's needs.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":null,"claim_uncertainty":[{"claim":"The cost

{"instruction":"In Harry Potter And The Order of The Phoenix, Voldemort attempts to kill Harry in the Ministry after Sirius's death. Dumbledore arrives just in time to save Harry, shielding him with the wizard's statue. \nWhy did he defend Harry there? He knew of him being a Horcrux after the attack on Arthur Weasley (on examining one of his instruments), and presumably knew he had to die at Riddle's hands.\nWhy did he postpone the inevitable? ","response":"It's hard to give a definitive reason for a fictional character's motivations when they aren't explicitly described anywhere, but there are any number of reasons events may have unfolded as they did.\n\n1. Dumbledore wasn't Voldemort-- he wasn't cool with murdering innocent people or allowing innocent people to die through inaction (certainly not in this phase of his life). He also showed a strong commitment to his students' safety and wellbeing, even in the case of a student that he knew for a fact was actively trying to murder him. Killing someone because it would be convenient or helpful is not a Professor Dumbledore move.\n\n2. It's not clear how much information Dumbledore had on the Horcruxes at that point. It's easy for a reader to look back at the novels and determine that Harry was 100% fated to die at some point in the struggle against Voldemort, but that's not a great guide an in-universe character's knowledge and motivations.\n\n3. Dumbledore was actively resisting Voldemort in every way he could manage at the time, and in particular wanted Voldemort's return to become public knowledge. It's not impossible that he viewed Voldemort's attack as an opportunity to injure, weaken, or otherwise frustrate Voldemort's efforts. At a minimum his approach was enough to force Ministry officials to accept that Voldemort was back, but it's also reasonable to think that if Voldemort clearly wanted something to happen, Dumbledore didn't want it to happen.\n\n4. Voldemort was clever and dangerous, and one of the few things Dumbledore could be pretty sure he would do was hunt Harry. With Harry dead, Voldemort would become less predictable but no less dangerous.\n\n5. Destroying all of the Horcruxes was important to defeating Voldemort but destroying any one was not-- that was the very reason Voldemort created so many of them. His being one seventh less immortal isn't an obviously huge setback for him, and indeed he did not seem to even notice that some of the Horcruxes were destroyed.\n\n6. The difficulty around the Horcruxes was mostly in finding and gaining possession of them, because Voldemort had hidden them away and protected them. Harry himself, on the other hand, was generally pretty easy to find over the course of the novels. Even if Dumbledore felt that Harry would need to die, there wasn't any reason that this particular opportunity for him to do so was unique or rare.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Three months ago, I submitted a manuscript to one of the most respected journals in my field. Today, I received comments from reviewers stating that my paper is not worth publishing in the journal. However, the editor decided to give it a major revision instead of outright rejection. Should I proceed to address all the questions posed by reviewers or should I just withdraw the paper and submit it elsewhere to save time?","response":"Based on the description, I would advise you to sleep on it, suck it up, respond to the reviewers, revise the paper, and submit your revision to the journal.\nYes, reviewers can be absolutely, disgustingly, and unnecessarily rude and mean. Read their review, filter their non-technical rants, keep whatever helpful criticism you can extract from their comments, and address them nicely and respectfully. It may actually be that the techniques you used were adequate but you failed to point out why and how it would be unnecessary to use more expensive methods. Always assume that they are right. If they are mistaken, respectfully point out in your response why you are right and edit the original manuscript to make the issue clearer to future readers.\n\nFor instance, if the reviewer wrote:\n\n> The methods used in the paper are abysmal. The authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale. The atomic mass interferometer, which uses gravitational waves and is able to precisely infer mass with an uncertainty of one atomic mass unit per kilogram, is the state of the art in weighting.\n\nYou can write as a response:\n\n* The reviewer is absolutely correct that atomic mass interferometry (AMI) is the state of the art in weighting. However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance).","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I was told in a Latin class that the name Christopher has Greek roots that mean \"one who carries Christ\". I assume that the Latin connection here is fero, which is the verb to carry. \nWith that in mind, does the name Jennifer have a similar derivation? If so what would she be carrying?","response":"It's a perfect example of a false cognate pair that is created by a sort of linguistic homogenization. When we come across foreign words, we pronounce them with our own sounds, mapping a foreign sound to one natural to our own ear that seems close enough for our purposes. Unrelated sounds and syllables from unrelated languages might in this way each get mapped to a single native sound\/syllable. In this way, we come to hear the sounds and syllables as related when they are not.\n\nMesoamerican languages, for instance, did not have a \"v\" sound. Consequently, when learning Spanish, the natives of Central America had a devil of time with the fairly common v sound and ended up usually pronouncing it as a b. The b sound is related to the v sound, so it wasn't a subtle shift. In consequence, very often to this day words like \"votar\" (to vote) get pronounced identically with words like \"botar\" (to throw out) giving rise to numerous puns. When native Spanish speakers from Latin America learn English, they are often heard saying things like \"Thank you bery much,\" as a result. But \"bery,\" and its false homophones \"berry\" and \"bury\" have no shared ancestry.\n\nAs a last point of interest, consider English spelling. It is so difficult precisely because speakers of English and the academic sources that safeguard the English language (Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, etc.) have made a general decision to preserve as best as possible the original spelling of the words in their original languages, making only occasional modifications to bring them into some kind of conventional conformity. So the Greek suffix -\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is conventionally transliterated as -pher, whereas the ending of Gwenhwyfar gets transliterated as -fer and the ending of aquifer stays as the Romans wrote it: -fer. This makes our spelling a bear to get a handle of, but it also locks the secret of most words' origins right into the words themselves. That means, once one has understood a bit of Latin, Greek, some common Celtic endings and a bit of German, one can almost always discern the origins of the word just by looking at it. Of course, it also means that we have to spend years and years memorizing spelling word lists and still relying on spellchecker far more than we care to admit.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}

And the sense of a screen as something for the projection of images derives from the fact that it was originally often a screen which was used for displaying objects for exhibition, pictures, photographs etc. \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary describes this meaning of screen in this way:\n\n> (b) Of images; e.g. a flat vertical surface prepared for the reception of images from a magic lantern or the like; spec. (i) a usually large white surface for receiving the image from a film projector; (ii) a small fluorescent screen, esp. one in a television set or a computer monitor; hence, the monitor itself; (iii) transf.

If we are both constantly correcting and instructing in tandem, is that bad? Should one parent act as an advocate while the other is tough on the rules?

If the toddler can't eat before dinner, nor can Daddy. If feet aren't allowed on the couch then that's the rule, not just \"if Mommy's looking.\" This kind of consistency isn't cruel or ganging up. You are showing your child the \"laws of physics\" of your home. This is how things go. Trying to understand mommy rules, daddy rules, sitter rules, grandparent rules - that's complicated! Remember, abiding by these rules isn't something mean or unfair, it's how life works in your house. And the toddler is trying to learn that. Make it as smooth as you can, and that includes being consistent, and not seeing the rules as mean.","primary_tag":"Advice seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Temperature conversion:\n$$273 + \\text{degree Celsius} = \\text{Kelvin}$$\nActually why is that $273$? How does one come up with this?","response":"One Celsius (or Kelvin) degree as a temperature difference was defined as 1\/100 of the temperature difference between the freezing point of water and boiling point of water. These points are called 0 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, respectively. The number 100 arose because we're used to numbers that are powers of ten because we use the base-ten system. The Celsius degree is \"one percent\" of the temperature difference.\n\nThere also exists the minimum temperature that one may achieve. In Kelvin degrees, it's sensible to call this minimum 0 K: that's a primary condition on the \"natural\" temperature scales such as the Kelvin scale. If one insists that one Kelvin degree is equally large as one Celsius degree as a unit of temperature difference, it just turns out that the melting point of ice has to be 273.15 K and the boiling point of water is 373.15 K. It's because the temperature difference between the boiling and freezing points is 2.7315 times smaller than the temperature difference between the minimum allowed temperature, the absolute zero, and the freezing point of water.\n\nThe value 2.7315 cannot be easily explained in simple words. It represents a specific characteristic related to water, a natural phenomenon that arises from the principles of quantum mechanics. To understand this value, extensive simulations are required to analyze the behavior of water molecules across a wide range of temperatures. Through experimental evidence, we have confirmed that this value accurately reflects the properties of water.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Math","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"I am from Kenya. Can I travel to the Netherlands to seek asylum with out a visa, because I want to seek asylum? Will Kenya Airways allow me to board a plane with out a visa to Schiphol Airport, considering I have my passport?","response":"The answer appears to be no: it is extremely unlikely that the airline will allow you to board. A Kenyan citizen who wishes to enter the Netherlands must have a visa, proof of sufficient funds to cover their stay, and documents necessary for entry to their next destination. What's more, airlines are required to give special scrutiny to passengers from Kenya:\n\n> Airlines flying from the following airports to the Netherlands:\n\nAbu Dhabi (AUH), Accra (ACC), Bahrain (BAH), Beijing Capital (PEK), Boryspil (KBP), Cairo (CAI), Damman (DMM), Dar Es Salaam (DAR), Dubai (DXB), Entebbe (EBB), Guangzhou (CAN), Hong Kong (HKG), Hamad (DOH), Istanbul Ataturk (IST), Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen (SAW), Johannesburg (JNB), Kigali (KGL), Kilimanjaro (JRO), Kuala Lumpur (KUL), Kuwait (KWI), Lagos (LOS), Moscow Sheremetyevo (SVO), Muscat (MCT), Nairobi (NB ), New Delhi (DEL), Sao Paulo (GRU), Singapore (SIN) and Teheran (IKA) must provide copies of travel documents of all passengers on these flights in case they do not hold proper travel documents upon arrival i the Netherlands and are inadmissible. Copies must include the data page of the passport\/travel document, the page with the visa and the page with departure\/clearance stamp, where applicable. Non-compliance with these entry regulations will result in fines up to EUR 11,250.\u2013 per passenger for the carrier.\n\nAs you can see from the last sentence, the airline will have a strong incentive to check your travel documents before you board the plane.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Advice seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Apparently, the air inside a soap bubble is under higher pressure than the surrounding air. This is for instance apparent in the sound bubbles make when they burst. Why is the pressure inside the bubble higher in the first place?","response":"The increased pressure is caused by the surface tension between the soap and the surrounding air. This can be seen by a simple equilibrium energy argument. The total energy of the system reads\n$$\n  E = E_i + E_o + E_s \\;,\n$$\nwhere $E_i$ is the energy associated with the air inside the bubble, $E_s$ is the interfacial energy, and $E_o$ denotes the energy associated with the air outside of the bubble. Importantly, the contribution of the surface energy is given by $E_s = 2 \\gamma A$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $A$ is the surface area of the bubble. The factor of 2 emerges, since there are actually two interfaces (one facing the inside of the soap bubble and one facing the outside).\n\nIn equilibrium, the total energy will be minimal. We thus analyze the total differential of the energy. Here, the differentials of the partial energies of the air can be approximated by the ideal gas law, which yields $dE_i = -p_i dV_i$ and $dE_o = -p_o dV_o$.\n\nNext, we have to discuss the degrees of freedom of the system. Generally, the soap bubble wants to keep its spherical shape to minimize the surface area (and thus the surface energy $E_s$) at a given volume. This leaves us with a single parameter, the radius $R$ of the bubble, which can be varied in any process. The volume differentials then become $dV_1 = 4\\pi R^2 dR$ and $dV_2 = -4\\pi R^2 dR$. Additionally, the surface area changes by $dA = 8\\pi R dR$. The differential of the surface energy thus reads $dE_s = 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR$, provided that the surface tension stays constant.\n\nNow we got everything and can express the differential of the total energy as\n$$\n  dE = -p_i 4 \\pi R^2 dR + p_o 4\\pi R^2 dR + 2\\gamma 8\\pi R dR \\;.\n$$\nDividing by $4\\pi R^2$ and noting that $dE\/dR$ vanishes in equilibrium, we thus arrive at\n$$\n  p_i - p_o = \\frac{4\\gamma}{R} \\;.\n$$\nThis expression shows that the pressure inside the bubble is large than outside. The pressure difference is two times the Laplace pressure $2\\gamma\/R$.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Resistance is due to collision with protons, and pretty much everything contains protons. So technically is everything a resistor? (Or at least, can anything be a resistor?)","response":"First, regarding \"resistance is due to collision with protons\" in your question:\n\nActually, there are lots of materials which don't contain protons outside of atomic nuclei \u2014 e.g. steel, glass, oxygen \u2014 but all these do have resistance. Dominant factors determining resistance vary from material to material: these can be scattering of electrons\/holes by motion of atomic nuclei (i.e. by phonons), by point-like defects in the crystals, etc.. Scattering by protons you mention is a very specific case of scattering by impurities (crystal defects).\n\nSecond, regarding \"technically is everything a Resistor?(or atleast, anything can be a Resistor?)\" in your question:\n\nYes, anything can be a resistor, in suitable conditions. One important property of a resistor is that it obeys Ohm's law. If you apply too high voltage to e.g. pure silicon, its conductivity will abruptly increase due to electrical breakdown. In this range of voltages the piece of material shouldn't be considered a resistor. Or if you take a piece of mercury, cool it down below 4.2 kelvins, its resistivity will become exactly zero (superconductivity), after which it can't be considered a resistor.\n\nSimilarly with other materials \u2013 in the right conditions they'll be good enough resistors, outside of these conditions they aren't.","primary_tag":"Reasoning","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"How do I remove a Git submodule?","response":"In modern git, this has become quite a bit simpler:\n\n* Run `git rm <path-to-submodule>`, and commit.\n\nThis removes the filetree at `<path-to-submodule>`, and the submodule's entry in the `.gitmodules` file, i.e. all traces of the submodule in your repository proper are removed.\n\nHowever, the `.git` dir of the submodule is kept around (in the `modules\/` directory of the main project's `.git` dir), to make it possible to checkout past commits without requiring fetching from another repository.\n\nIf you nonetheless want to remove this info, manually delete the submodule's directory in `.git\/modules\/`, and remove the submodule's entry in the file `.git\/config`. These steps can be automated using the commands:\n\n* `rm -rf .git\/modules\/<path-to-submodule>`, and\n* `git config --remove-section submodule.<path-to-submodule>`.","primary_tag":"Coding & Debugging","other_tags":"Information seeking","claim_uncertainty":null}
{"instruction":"Why aren't python nested functions called closures?","response":"A closure occurs when a function has access to a local variable from an enclosing scope that has finished its execution. For example, \n\n```\ndef make_printer(msg):\n    def printer():\n        print(msg)\n    return printer\nprinter = make_printer('Foo!')\nprinter()\n```\n\nWhen `make_printer` is called, a new frame is put on the stack with the compiled code for the `printer` function as a constant and the value of `msg` as a local. It then creates and returns the function. Because the function `printer` references the `msg` variable, it is kept alive after the `make_printer` function has returned.\nSo, if your nested functions don't\n\n* access variables that are local to enclosing scopes,\n* do so when they are executed outside of that scope,\n\nthen they are not closures.\n\nHere's an example of a nested function which is not a closure.\n```\ndef make_printer(msg):\n    def printer(msg=msg):\n        print(msg)\n    return printer\nprinter = make_printer(&quot;Foo!&quot;)\nprinter()  # Output: Foo!\n```\nHere, we are binding the value to the default value of a parameter. This occurs when the function `printer` is created and so no reference to the value of `msg` external to `printer` needs to be maintained after `make_printer` returns. `msg` is just a normal local variable of the function `printer` in this context.","primary_tag":"Information seeking","other_tags":"Reasoning,Coding & Debugging","claim_uncertainty":null}
